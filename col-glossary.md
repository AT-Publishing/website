This is the crypto traders' glossary, for lack of better term.

What you will find here are the most common technical indicators that are used in crypto trading. Each has a super short explanation of the concept and links to more thorough content.

There's some of the funny crypto jargon as well, though: The Squishy, the Bart, the BGD, we have it all.
