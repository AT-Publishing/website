Welcome to the **crypto traders' glossary** on **ATNET** (AltcoinTrading.NET).

This is the place where you will find all the crypto trading jargon you ever wanted to understand but was afraid to ask.

A lot of crypto jargon are actually nicknames for common indicators from technical analysis. Those glossary entries have a super short explanation of the concept and then links to more thorough content here on ATNET.

Most of the jargon is just funny, though. [The Squishy](/glossary/squishy/), [the Bart and Trab](/glossary/bart/), [the BGD](/glossary/bgd/) - we have it all.

We are throwing into the mix some 101 on technical analysis and basic market principles.
