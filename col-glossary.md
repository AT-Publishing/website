This is the crypto traders' glossary on **ATNET** (AltcoinTrading.NET).

What you will find all the crypto trading jargon you even wanted to understand but was afraid to ask.

A lot of crypto jargon are actually nicknames for common indicators from technical analysis. Those glossary entries have a super short explanation of the concept and then links to more thorough content here on ATNET.

Most of the jargon is just funny, though. Don't worry: [The Squishy](/glossary/squishy/), [the Bart and Trab](/glossary/bart/), [the BGD](/glossary/squishy/) - we have it all.
