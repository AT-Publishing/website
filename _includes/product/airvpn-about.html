<p>AirVPN is the well known VPN provider that accepts Bitcoin and altcoin payments (directly, without any intermediaries) because user privacy in all aspects is the core of the product. The AirVPN.org website doesn't even track cookies or marketing data.</p>
<p>If you don't want to waste your crypto on AirVPN subscription, they also accept <strong>PayPal, debit cards and credit cards</strong>.</p>
<p>AirVPN have their own native client for all desktop and mobile platforms, but you can also generate the ovpn files and use them with any standard OpenVPN app. <a href="http://bit.ly/airvpn-2020">There's a community forum</a> in case it is the first time you're setting this up.</p>
<p>If you use VPN regularly, it definitely pays off to wait for the next AirVPN Black Friday offer and get the <strong>three year plan</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need VPN now as one-off, get one of the <a href="http://bit.ly/airvpn-2020">cheaper short plans</a> now and rebuy a long one on Black Friday.</p>
