TensorCharts is an advanced charting platform with orderbook heatmap and split-colored candles. Tensorcharts were developed for crypto traders exclusively, but during the 2019 bear market the platform also started focusing on **legacy markets trading** aside of crypto markets and mainstream bitcoin futures.

TensorCharts are targeting more dedicated crypto traders who are not afraid to spend a little bit of time wrapping their head around the functionalities.

The learning curve is there, but this is what actually gives you the trading edge in the end.

TensorCharts can be a particularly useful tool for [scalping crypto](/strategy/scalping/).
