<h4>Why go PRO on TradingView: TradingView PRO vs PRO+</h4>
<p>You can keep using TradingView FREE forever but you can only save a one single chart.</p>
<p>That means you can only watch one market at a time, not for instance like BTCUSD next to ETHUSD.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have no access to intraday spread (looking into arbitrage opportunities between different fiat denominations on shorter timeframes than 1D) and the number of indicators or scripts per chart is limited to 3. That would be perhaps <a href="/glossary/bbands/">bbands</a>, <a href="/glossary/ichimoku/">ichimoku cloud</a> and MACD and you cannot even volume color your candles.</p>
<p>With the PRO+ plan you can save 4 layouts and access them from 2 devices, you get 30 server side alerts for either price targets or indicator value targets. You have the allowance of 10 strategies or indicators per chart.</p>
<p>TradingView is the most popular charting and alert tool for cryptocurrency traders to this day. It is reliable, it doesn't take up as much memory as cryptowatch and if you are willing to block 100+ people in the chat, you will find the community stunning. (Just kidding. It's a great charting platform though.)</p>
