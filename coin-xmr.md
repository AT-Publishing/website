**Monero vs Bitcoin**

Monero has far more enhanced privacy features compared to Bitcoin: stealth addresses & ring signatures

* Stealth addresses make sure your balance of your wallet is private by default. Unlike with Bitcoin, Monero transactions to a particular wallet cannot be linked together.
* Ring signatures make sure individual transaction outputs on the blockchain can’t be traced. Ring signatures give Monero fungibility, there can never be "dirty" Monero coins.
