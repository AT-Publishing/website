## About the platform

Cryptoloans is a platform that specializes in margin lending for trading directly on the platform. The profitability expectations of the platform are based on the projections of future growth of cryptocurrency markets. The growing interest in cryptocurrencies should result in growth of interest in all aspects of trading - speculation, arbitrage or hedging. Given the current popularity of leveraged trading, Cryptoloans are developing a platform where both lenders and margin traders would be able to enter the market regardless of their social class or status.

Main focus of the CryptoLoans Platform can be split into three parts:

* P2P Lending as a way of earning interest on cryptocurrency assets. Being built on the Ethereum blockchain, the borrowed money is locked up in a contract and never leaves the platform until the loan is repaid or defaults. The borrower can use the borrowed assets for trading or lending before the loan is repaid, only withdrawal out of the platform is blocked.
* Margin trading on an ERC20 platform implemented as buying on credit. The trading system is similar to OTC trading, the leveraged position is not liquidated during volatility as with a credit contract on CryptoLoans there is no maintenance margin requirement. The only condition is the borrower must repay his or her loan before the lending contract expires. Failure to repay the loan means the creditor receives the initial asset back and also keeps all borrower's payments that were received.
* Cryptocurrency markets with more cryptocurrencies as the base. Exchanges and trading platforms typically do not provide pairs of less popular cryptocurrencies, such as for instance ZEC/ZEN. The trading platform will feature advanced tools such as automated trading.

The goal of CryptoLoans is to democratize the cryptocurrency market, working against its further monopolization.

The core team consists of CEO Dmitry Zhurba, engineer of algorithmic trading systems, CTO Oleg Zlotnyk, developer with experience in projects for the National Bank of Ukraine and Dmitriy Plekhanov, systems engineer.

The official digital token of the CryptoLoans platform is LoanCoin (LCN), token used for fee payments and operations on the platform. Exchange rate is 1 ETH = 300 LCN. LoanCoins cannot be sold to residents of United States, China, Singapore, South Korea and other countries where the sale of the token may require registration as a security.
