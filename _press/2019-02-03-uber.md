The online payment app [Vendit](https://coinvendit.com) has now added Uber among their supported partners.

Vendit is a blockchain-based fintech app that is working in a host of very diverse areas of interest.

They are building a payment system APIs to effectively connect trading on existing exchanges for their clients, they run their own hybrid DEX/CEX, they are dabbing into blockchain-based loans and they have developed a payment system for merchants.

While Vendit focuses strongly on B2B payments (and commissions), the payment system is also accessible in a user-friendly form from Vendit app, which makes it easy to spend your cryptocurrency on your every day expenses - at least as long as they come with a hipster smartphone app. Uber now freshly joins the ranks of GameStop, Domino's or IHOP.

Vendit is putting reasonable amount of hope into the new payment link to Uber as it is pretty much a household name among the new gig economy apps and at the same time one that is still very commonly used.

The popularity of Uber could bring Vendit a good amount of new users who will be curious how funding a ride via cryptocurrency token works at all.

Future-wise, it could be wise to keep up with Vendit's development as they have already implemented a cashback service for shopping at selected fashion retail stores. If the app gains a steady user base, the cashback options will probably grow.

*As of late 2018, a substantial amount of equity in Vendit Payment Systems is owned by [Libereum, a European digital currency firm](https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/intelligence/libereum-crypto-investment-acquired-spanish-elche-cf/) that has been acquiring football clubs across the world and developing use cases for cryptocurrency payments within sports merchandise and football management backoffice.*
