*LONDON* â€“ CrowdIF is a new platform on the Ethereum blockchain that is setting up to collect public sentiment data in order to project the price development of a selected project's token.

CrowdIF is launching a trading platform and a utility token that is starting a token sale in June 2018. There is a bounty active since May 2018.

## About CrowdIF

CrowdIF is a trading platform that is capable of harnessing the power of the *Collective Intelligence of the Crowd* and includes it in a major way in its crypto-trading strategy. CrowdIF is capable of objectively gathering something as abstract as market sentiment and quantify it. This is called the quantified market sentiment or SentimentScore&trade;.

## Why Crowd Sentiment

As is widely known, market sentiment plays a vital role in defining the direction of crypto market movements. Capitalizing upon SentimentScore gives CrowdIF an edge to consistently outperform the market.

## The CrowdIF Process

The Collective Intelligence of Crowd is a four step process:

* High Quality Data Aggregation
The system aggregates realtime data using crawling and scraping algorithms. Part of the data aggregation is community-sourced, users who contribute earn CIFcoins.

* Realtime Sentiment Analysis
Natural Language Processing and advanced mathematical modeling are used to perform realtime sentiment analysis. The product is the proprietary SentimentScore&trade;.

* Price Predictions
The sentiment analysis results are combined with other market signals to make price movement predictions with unprecedented accuracy.

* Insight based Trading
The CrowdIF trading algorithms trade 24x7 across cryptocurrency markets.
