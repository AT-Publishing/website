#### About BitMEX

BitMEX is a cryptocurrency derivative platform. You cannot buy altcoins or bitcoin on BitMEX with your national currency, you can only trade their products for profit. You get your winnings paid out in BTC.

Currently the most traded products are BTC futures, ETH futures and BTC perpetual swap (derivative mimicking spot BTCUSD market). In addition to that, BitMEX sometimes opens betting on upcoming events in the crypto markets - the betting market for the COIN ETF was up in February 2017.

* Leverage is dynamic between 1x and 100x. Trade with caution, many overleveraged traders cause margin cascades on BitMEX.
* Fees are changeable - depending on the market and whether you're long or short.
* Derivatives have a mark price based on Coinbase, Bitstamp and Kraken spot.
* The dynamic way of perpetual swap funding makes it possible to trade non-speculative positions that will only earn from funding payouts.

**BitMEX doesn't serve US customers**. However there is no verification other than a claim from the user on sign up. The exchange is accessible from a VPN or from the Tor network.
