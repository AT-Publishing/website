#### About Bitfinex

Bitfinex is a custodial crypto trading platform that provides spot trading, leveraged trading and crypto futures trading.

As a company, Bitfinex as well as its related companies is based in British Virgin Islands under *iFinex*.

Bitfinex exchange was hacked in August 2016.

Despite the hack it managed to retain a wide user base thanks to its powerful trading interface for desktop and also its great [Bitfinex mobile app](/bitfinex-app/).

* Bitfinex offers a wide range of markets denominated in USD, EUR, JPY from the fiat choices and BTC, ETH, EOS and many more for the crypto pairs.
* Tether markets as well as withdrawals are available, but dollar pairs on Bitfinex trade against USD, not Tether.
* Margin markets are funded via a public P2P lending system. Identity verification is not needed for lending.
* Bitfinex opened a derivatives section of the platform in September 2019.

The user interface on Bitfinex has embedded charts from [TradingView PRO](https://bit.ly/3dGlz3O). The charts offer wide range of indicators for technical analysis.

The Bitfinex exchange is available worldwide. There is limitation on margin trade for Americans - however the exchange is still operational from American IP address. New users on US IP just have to state they are not American residents.

**No identity verification is needed other than for fiat withdrawal.** There might be restrictions for Bitfinex futures based on your location.
