#### About Bitfinex (the custodial & futures crypto exchange)

Bitfinex is a BVI-based exchange infamous for being hacked in August 2016. Despite the hack it managed to retain a wide user base thanks to its powerful trading interface and great mobile app.

* Bitfinex offers a wide range of markets denominated in USD, EUR, JPY from the fiat choices and BTC, ETH, EOS and many more for the crypto pairs.
* Tether withdrawals are available but the markets on Bitfinex trade against USD, not Tether.
* Margin markets are funded via a public P2P lending system. Identity verification is not needed for lending.

The user interface on Bitfinex has embedded charts with wide range of indicators for technical analysis. Charts are provided by [TradingView PRO](https://bit.ly/3dGlz3O).

The Bitfinex exchange is available worldwide. There is limitation on margin trade for Americans - however the exchange is still operational from American IP address. New users on US IP just have to state they are not American residents.
