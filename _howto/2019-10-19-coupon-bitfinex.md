* Tether withdrawals are available but the markets on Bitfinex trade against USD, not Tether.

**Ethfinex.com is discontinued since 12 October 2019 and decentralized trading moves on to DeversiFi. Users who have balance on EthFinex will be able to access it through Bitfinex after the Ethfinex app goes offline.**

DeversiFi is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that runs on that enables trading of tokens and any other cryptocurrency (even BTC) in it's 'wrapped' form. The platform is owned and maintained by the same company as the Bitfinex exchange, but it is [non-custodial](/dex-trading/).

On DeversiFi, you don't sign up and you trade directly from your [hardware or software cryptocurrency wallet](/altcoin-wallets/).
