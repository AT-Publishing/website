The year 2017 was the year to buy your crypto in January and hold. Then, maybe, if you felt like it, to [spot a range](/strategy/wyckoff-ranging-markets) and sell the right bounce to rebuy lower and carry on the Ms Bones' wild ride. But all good things come to an end. In 2018, the first most obvious thing everyone noticed is that everyone's long-term stacks keep losing their dollar value. There is another effect of this though.

Judging from Google Trends, a lot of new people got into cryptocurrencies as they started hearing about the doubling...tripling...you what, 10k?...and so on. Another crop, now already oldtimers, came at the start of the bull run in late 2016. There are not many people who went through the previous bull-bear cycle and are still active in the community; the number of crypto-born professionals who trade on a daily basis is also still quite low. At the current state of the market the majority of traders will stop trading during sideways and negative price actions.

Not only get people frustrated as the price keeps going down and they "cannot do anything" (*please buy sirs*), consequently losing sleep and perhaps also money. As an overall result the markets also get thinner, meaning candles get easier to paint and the decreased volumes are inviting for trolls and MSM to showcase cryptocurrencies are dying for real this time which can easily spiral into more panic.

It is no doubt good to know when not to trade in order to minimize losses but it should be really the last resort, provided there are stop-loss orders, arbitrage and other direction-independent strategies, market making and basically any kind of short term trading.

There are still money on the table, why not trade no matter the mid-term direction then?

## About Scalping

What is scalping?

> Scalping [noun] - trading technique of capitalizing on small price changes. Positions are typically closed as soon as they become profitable, earning a small profit.

Scalping requires a 5M or 15M chart with indicators that work well there, stable exchange or API and definitely, definitely a reliable stop loss. In a trading strategy where you collect a lot of small profits from a big number of trades losers need to be cut quickly with a discipline as a single large loss could wipe out what you felt was a hard work, putting you psychologically in a bad place.

## Your scalping tool

> The anatomy of the candle has a lot more information than the simple information of OHCL. OHCL and colour of the candle only gives you the very superficial average information.


Your best tool of choice for any short-term crypto trades are [TensorCharts](https://tensorcharts.com), hands down. The information you get when watching TensorCharts is far more complete than the thinned-down, averaged-out information one can get from the standard candlesticks charts.

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="button" href="https://tensorcharts.com">Go to TensorCharts</a></p>

We've published intro to the TensorCharts project [here](/tensorcharts), but if you are looking more into learning what TensorCharts are and what can they do for you, an Argentinian gentleman called Nico made a series of tutorials [on the Learning Nodes YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvoU3qw-qRydTI--GGlIz9w). The videos were shot in March 2018 so you will get to learn about the current updated version of TensorCharts with a bunch of new markets and functionalities.

In this section I will stick to the point of short-term trades and point out the minimum you need to know to work with TensorCharts, starting with a 5-minute video that shows you around the interface.

#### Working with TensorCharts: The story inside the candle

##### Different types of orders

With TensorCharts you get to see at pretty much single glance three types of orders for each time span defined by a candlestick:

* orders that were posted in any previous time span but did not get hit
* orders that got hit in a time span
* currently posted orders, waiting to be hit or taken down

##### Not just average volume

For each candle - that is the orders that got hit - you get to see volume blocks for each price level, the more intensive colour tone the more volume was concentrated at that price level.

This is the *order flow*, the story inside the candle.

It has a lot more information than the simple information of open-high-low-close candle. The OHCL and overall colour of the candle only give you very superficial information and for very short term speculation, having the better data can give you a critical edge.

Watch Nico's second video explaining these and other functionalities in a more detailed way:

##### Interminent support/resistance levels



A longer introduction into the functionality:

* buys vs sell
* orders that were placed but never hit in that timeframe of the candle
* if you only want to see the whales change the volume filters
* volume profile [actually traded] -> support/resistance
* hilit levels with big asks/bid -> support/resistance


SR
* currenct orders
* compared to orders that were never hit


Orders:
* never hit
* hit
* currently posted

Book counter: orders that are placed [not hit]

!! counters ratio: how did the small players vs big players executed orders evolved on a selected timeframe
!! trades counter usage!!


### Short-term trades with TensorCharts


Strategies:

* tools: volume, volume profile

No such thing as general rule. History rhymes, doesn't repeat. The focus on the market will determine the 'reality' whatchu see.

* traps

* suckers - top of the candle with DENSE purchases but in total the sell vol (in vol bars below) the sell vol is picking up

### Article


1. real-time s/r levels
2. the generic mood - when it's not a good idea to be scalping
3. what do small peeps vs whales do
4. traps

supply and demand in real time --> actors with a lot of supply and then a huge demand at the bottom of a candle --> more likely to go up until sell vol wins again
