Fibs, or Fibonacci retracement -- the bread and butter of cryptocurrency trading when your pair keeps making ATHs. Or if it just <a class="internal" href="https://www.altcointrading.net/strategy/wyckoff-ranging-markets">breaks from a range</a>. Why Fibs? Because everybody uses them. Nobody knows if they work, let alone how, but everyone uses them, which makes them self-fulfilling prophecy.

## About Fibs

If you want to know more about Fibs in general, [here is a deep dive from stockcharts](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:fibonacci_retracemen). As to how they work, they basically just explain the Fib levels are based on the [Fibonacci sequence](https://math.temple.edu/~reich/Fib/fibo.html), and why that particular sequence is relevant, that remains secret.

Not that you'd need to know to make money.

What you need to know is that Fib levels are, according to some more or less opaque theory, the price levels where the relevant trend is more likely to reverse. It can be short-term reversal, start of a corrective range or start of a bear market - Fibs don't tell you any of this, they are just levels to pay attention to. It is also not meant to be particularly precise -- it's just *levels* people -- nor is it meant to work out every single time -- it's just *probability*. No point in being too religious about it.

#### How to draw Fibonacci retracement

In **downtrend**/**correction or corrective range** draw the Fib by dragging from the swing high to the swing low.

In an **uptrend** or for **DCB/bounce** draw the Fib by dragging from the swing low to the swing high.

#### Platforms that let you draw Fibs

If you are looking for a free charting tool that lets you draw Fibonacci retracement, you won't find this function on [Cryptowatch](https://cryptowat.ch) but it is still available on [Bitcoinwisdom](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitfinex/btcusd).

It is better to be able to save your charts though, especially if you are working with longer timeframes like the daily where it might take some time before the market moves toward the next fib. For that, use [TradingView](http://tradingview.go2cloud.org/SH1Je) like the rest of us.

## Why Fibs actually matter?

Here comes the real deal.



// because range --> overshooting that still makes sense etc.
