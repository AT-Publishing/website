In April 2018, [John Bollinger asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bbands/status/981267684493963264) what are everyone's favorite technical indicators they most rely on. Given that it's John Bollinger we may safely assume people weren't lying too much because many aspire to be like him when they grow up.

The results were not very surprising - traders generally flock to the same things and unless you live under a rock you know that as for crypto trading the same chart setups get recycled over the whole of cryptotwitter and cryptoreddit as well. There is nothing wrong with that, on the contrary, it is precisely the reason why basic technical analysis still very often works.

> It is certainly possible to tell whether it is time for daring or time for caution

One thing that does not get talked about so much though is that this is not all there is: purely technical approach is fine and can certainly make you good money. What it completely ignores though is the overall situation on the markets. That requires a little different approach that does not need you to change much on the daily, but in the crucial moments it can save you a FOMO that would ultimately lead to bad decisions that seemed like good ones because you only considered a chart for a single cryptocurrency.

While it might be the truth that time in the market beats timing the market, it is certainly possible to tell whether it is time for daring or time for caution. If you are not a very active trader, it can still make you a good profit during a time your portfolio would otherwise be in a drawdown. If you are more actively trading, you can consider this as a way to establish the level - the kind of information you are looking for on longer timeframes - to make a trade out of it you will still need to get an actual setup and then wait for a trigger.

## Using the crypto indexes

There are many general ideas on the legacy markets on how to very roughly see where the market is at, most of them cannot be directly used on the cryptocurrency markets but you will find there is analogous information available.

When you look up articles about market timing, classical sources will usually mention things like unemployment rates, treasury yield curves, weekly and seasonal cycles and developments in industries that are most sensitive to changes in public psychology (such as entertainment or health industries). These are very broad and generic things and while in cryptocurrencies one can draw broad conclusions from transaction rates, the popularity of cryptokitties or attempts to buy bitcoins on credit, it is not something to really trade on.

Digging into more technical aspects of the market timing is where it gets interesting, and for that we will investigate something that was finally established for the crypto markets as well: reliable basket indexes.

The indexes that have been created for crypto markets were modeled after the legacy ones, with some adjustments - after all, the cryptocurrency market is in its infancy, it is volatile and most of its USD value comes from a single coin. Nonetheless, we now have both market cap weighted indexes that mimick S&P 500 or NASDAQ and a price weighted index that has its closest legacy variant in Japanese Nikkei.

#### Market cap weighted cryptocurrency indexes

**CCI30** - [cci30.com](https://cci30.com/)

https://cci30.com/ has CSV - daily and over quarter!!!!!!!

**Crypto20** - [crypto20.com](https://crypto20.com/en/portal/exchange/)

https://crypto20.com/en/portal/performance/

Crypto20 is a byproduct of a tokenized investment fund that [trades on the decentralized exchange IDEX under the ticker C20](https://idex.market/eth/c20). While you can get the price data programatically from [the IDEX API](https://github.com/AuroraDAO/idex-api-docs) the data about the composition is more difficult to get.

Only here: https://crypto20.com/en/portal/performance/

#### Price weighted cryptocurrency indexes

**CryptoCompare** - [cryptocompare.com](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/how-does-our-cryptocurrecy-index-work/)

Our index uses a VWAP approach (Volume Weighted Average Price) taking into account the past 24 hours volume. - https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/12318004/cccagg.pdf

## The Theory

. why you need indicators - the gist behind it




.you compare the index with a single, the actual weight does not mean that much but you should have a rough idea what the index represents
.


### Breadth Thrust

Breadth Thrust is the only indicator of the triplet mentioned. for ENTRY

Gotta test this on shorter timeframes because normally this is used for massive bull runs only. The thrust occurs if over period of 10 days (2 weeks) the BT moves from 40 to over 61.5. It’s a ratio of EMA and adv/decl issues of an INDEX.

### Advance - Decline contributions

Advance/Decline Line for EXIT

How the advances compare to declines - in an index, number of individuals that are advancing in period vs declining in period. A bull div only occurs if broadening participation but price declines. Topping occurs when narrowing participation and non-decline in price.

.


This is something we have seen in January 2018: Bitcoin started to decline but some other markets where holding up surprisingly well - namely, the ETHUSD. In the crypto investing circles it became a legitimate question at that time: Will now BTC dump without bad effect on the alts? Will big altcoins carry on with their extravaganza? The Reddit forum EthTrader, having successfully coined the term *flippening*, dubbed it *the great decoupling*. The decoupling was not talked about again since ETH dumped to 400 USD a little later.

From the point of view of the technical timing tools, the *decoupling* was not even a question: The market participation in cryptocurrencies was narrowing, some coins were stronger than others but ultimately it was a signal that an overall correction was likely.

**Large cap cryptocurrencies**

**Small cap cryptocurrencies**

### Intraday Intensity Index

Intraday Intensity for ENTRY and EXIT

JB recommends to combine with band tagging. If price tags lower band it is relatively low, that’s a level, to get the setup look for positive values in IIIX, then look for trigger.

It’s a bizarre mess of high-low ratios. It’s supposed to single out the whales (bigger investors) though I don’t see it. It’s on TV by vegeta.

### Follow the legacy markets!

## The Test


will need to get these to tradingview bc I cannae be bothered calculating it!


btcusd, xmrusd
ethusd, eosusd, trxusd, omgusd
iotusd
xrpusd

vs: c20 prolly shit data
vs: sanusd (erc20 only!!)
vs: cci30

looking for: ADL divs, III positive on bottoms, BT
