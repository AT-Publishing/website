## The bigger picture

> 95% of traders look at the shop window instead of through it. This is what most traders do, they use indicators and candle formations and well.. most people lose.


--> stop hunts, overreactions. THEN finally breakout where retail is allowed to join in so that in the manias the MM can sell. They are not selling at once they are offloading gradually by small bits: when they accumulate they are buildig a POSITION.

.. So I will never look at Forex in the same way ever again. I will be plotting the likely areas where traders will place *Stop losses and focusing my attention closely at these point because that area is likely where price is going*.
