We are going to approach the topic in two ways: The market psychology and the trading psychology.

Technically, those are two different things. They are related, though. As a trader, your mindset and decision making is part of the market. The way you think and decide influences the way you act on the market, which helps form the aggregate market psychology.

What traders and researchers call crypto market psychology is the group behavior that results from actions of individual traders.

Not all traders act always the same way, obviously. If they did, the market would not exist because the market is made by exchange of value between the buyers and the sellers - two parties who act in opposition, not in agreement.

Because trading is a zero sum game, your aim as a trader when it comes to trading psychology is to be slightly ahead of the curve rather than with the prevailing opinion.

Research on Crypto Market Psychology

There has been quite good amount of research done on the psychology of the crypto markets. People have done sentiment analysis, price bias analysis, the influence of news, correlation.

There has been quite a lot done on the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies. This could fall under fundamental analysis: Looking for correlations or causal relationships between price and Bitcoin network activity, Google search counts, trading volume, active addresses. These papers tend to be quite handy if you are planning to set up some market monitoring and statistics. Here’s one for you.

Aalborg, Halvor Aarhus; Molnár, Peter; de Vries, Jon Erik

We study which variables can explain and predict the return, volatility and trading volume of Bitcoin. The considered variables are return, volatility, trading volume, transaction volume, change in the number of unique Bitcoin addresses, the VIX index and Google searches for “Bitcoin”. We use realized volatility calculated from high-frequency data and find that the heterogeneous autoregressive model is suitable for Bitcoin volatility. Trading volume further improves this volatility model. The trading volume of Bitcoin can be predicted from Google searches for “Bitcoin”. However, none of the considered variables can predict Bitcoin returns.

The situation with market psychology papers is quite different.

One thing you will notice when you skim through them is that some authors apparently don’t know anything about cryptocurrency markets and probably never looked into a crypto trading community chat in their life.

The bulk of the research at the moment are standard formulas applied on the crypto markets, with bizarre conclusions.

For instance, nobody in the traditional finance research world seems to be aware of the “alt season”, which as every crypto trader or investors knows is something that exists and influences most of all the daytraders and other short term speculators in crypto.

If there is an expectation that alt season is about to start, traders come pour money into the alt innovation hype of the week, which will result in all vapourware alts of the same focus to become correlated.

In the world of traditional finance there is no such thing. Small cap assets are treated as penny stocks that are not related to one another. Traditionally they are more volatile than large cap assets, but their price movements are not correlated. As a result, finance researchers will attribute this effect to cognitive biases of crypto traders.

Do you see how the crypto market psychology must look like in the eyes of a market analyst?

Your Individual Trading Psychology

Here is where your individual psychology comes into play.

Trading psychology is another word for the mindset, information gathering and decision making process that you employ when you are trading.

Information Collection

By now it should be obvious that mainstream finance news cannot be a good source for your information gathering. Your own research, your own insight and your own look into fundamental tech data will top any reputable mainstream resource in the long run.

Do not think that less mainstream sources will automatically do it either, though. Just go to TradingView market ideas and look what is getting most upvoted in tags like “beyondta” or in the Trading Psychology section.

Doing the exact opposite is probably a better choice, just like it is with CNBC calls for the crypto market.

Working with emotions

As for the mindset, the obvious trading mistakes are the same as with any kind of shopping.

Do not trade on your emotions, especially on fear. Fear is the chief marketing tool in many industries. Healthy food, fitness, beauty products - a lot of goods on these markets gets sold on fear.

Anyone who ever saw a correction on a cryptocurrency market will understand that a lot of crypto changes hands during periods of fear. You are probably never going to get rid of your emotions, but that is not a problem. Not acting on them is enough, and the only thing that takes is practice.

It doesn’t have to be practice on the market. Just keep in mind that if you are going to choose one emotion to start with, it should be a negative one, just like fear. Greed in crypto is somewhat less dangerous, because the upside potential for crypto is anything while the downside ends at zero.  

Be aware of your risks. Calculate them, even if with just ballpark figures. Decide for yourself if the trade has value for you at all.
Don’t want to do that? You can DCA. Dollar cost averaging works both ways - into crypto and out of it as well.

If you made a mistake, acknowledge it and try to salvage as much as possible.  

On the market this will translate into cutting your losses short.

Decisions should not be short-sighted

The catchphrase for your decision making is even simpler than what has been said so far. It goes like this - Remember the bigger picture.

In crypto markets, traders often live with the idea that the market is all there is to crypto. The trading is what keeps cryptocurrencies around, day trading is what makes the price discovery, blockchain technology is empty buzzword that has no consequence.

This is not true.

It was years after Google became the most used search engine when the search result page first started being used for business. To the OGs, web search was a tool for liberation of knowledge and personal freedom.

There was [a lot of revolt](https://web.archive.org/web/20000919045453/http://www.searchlores.org/antiadve.htm) among them when the “evil” business people started littering the search results with things that earn money:

{% amp700cloud border {{page.image[1]}} %}

It is obvious to see which party was on the right side of the history, and how quickly that happened. Within only a few years, a whole industry sprung up around search engine marketing, online publishing and advertising.

Online ads remained hugely underpriced compared to outdoors street adverts long after it became the norm that you’d see people walking outdoors staring exclusively into their phones.

It is true that most of ICOs were a waste of money, and the same fate awaits DeFi. But there is a whole network of small businesses growing around it, so why not?

The secondary industry is a part of the crypto market that is not a piece of the zero sum game, and passes mostly disregarded in analyses.
