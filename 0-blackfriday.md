## Hardware wallets

<div id="ledger"></div>

### Buy Ledger wallet on Black Friday

Ledger wallet is currently the most trusted hardware wallet for bitcoin and altcoins. The code is fully open source and the Ledger Nano S supports a mass of altcoins, including all ERC20 compliant tokens. Other than Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Zcash, Ethereum and forks, Ledger also supports cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Stratis via Ledger's Companion Apps.

Ledger Nano S also supports Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. Ledger is generally fast and diligent in Bitcoin fork support apps so the Nano S wallet is definitely a good choice if you are a BTC holder and want to be able to split coins safely. (Don't worry if you missed out so far, there will likely be more forks in the future.)

Ledger Nano S currently retails at a regular price of 69.90 EUR but on Black Friday customers get up to 21% discount and free shipping with a promo code they will publish on Black Friday.

<div id="trezor"></div>

### Buy Trezor wallet on Black Friday

Trezor is currently the second most popular hardware wallet for BTC and alternative cryptocurrencies. They lost a bunch of bitcoiner clients due to their unclear messages regarding the BTC forks support. There was also recently a [vulnerability found in Trezor wallets that was patched before it was exploited](https://www.altcointrading.net/trezor-hack). [Learn more about Trezor vs Ledger here](https://www.altcointrading.net/altcoin-wallets/).

Trezor supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Dash, Ethereum and ERC20 via MyEtherWallet.

The regular price of Trezor wallet is 99 USD per device but on Black Friday customers get 20 USD off. Trezors ship via DHL signed parcels and come sealed -- if your seal is damaged, you will get a new device or refund.

SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor, will announce the [2017 deals on their blog](https://blog.trezor.io).

## Cryptocurrency Charting & TA Tools

### TradingView Pro Black Friday Deal

TradingView has yearly Black Friday offer for a limited time where they go down with the subscription price considerably. Depending on your PRO plan, you end up with up to 50% discount.

#### Why go PRO on TradingView

You can keep using TradingView FREE forever but you can only save a one single chart. That means you can only watch one market at a time, nothing like BTCUSD nect to ETHUSD. Additionally, you have no access to intraday spread (looking into arbitrage opportunities between different fiat denominations on shorter timeframes than 1D) and the number of indicators or scripts per chart is limited to 3. That is perhaps bbands, ichimoku cloud and MACD and you cannot even volume color your candles.

With the PRO+ plan you can save 4 layouts and access them from 2 devices, you get 30 server side alerts for either price targets or indicator value targets. You have the allowance of 10 strategies or indicators per chart.

TradingView is the most popular charting and alert tool for cryptocurrency traders to this day. It is reliable, it doesn't take up as much memory as cryptowatch and if you are willing to block 100+ people in the chat, you will find the community stunning. (Just kidding. It's a great charting platform though.)

**We will pin a [Telegram note in our group](https://t.me/altcointrading_net) once TradingView releases their 2017 offers. You can also [sign up at TradingView for their free account](http://tradingview.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=3223&url_id=23&file_id=199) and monitor the announcements they make.**

### Coinigy Black Friday Deal

Coinigy is great for true altcoin traders who want to be the market makers in new markets, who want to leverage arb opportunities and need to stay up to date about opening markets. It is not only a charting engine but also an API interface you can use to access your exchange account without using the crypto exchange web interface, which is usually terrible with the exception of [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC) and [BitMEX](https://www.bitmex.com/register/iYQB44).

Coinigy doesn't charge any additional fee for executing trades via the platform.

The subscription plans prices differ based on the length of your subscription but on Black Friday, you can get a lifetime plan for as little as 3 USD a month. That's pretty much for free, and you get great charting engine, the possibility to trade on multiple exchanges from a single interface and notifications about new markets going live.
