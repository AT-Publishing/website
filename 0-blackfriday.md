## Special Offers: Get Black Friday Value before Black Friday 2019

#### TradingView Loves Bitcoin: 50% off when paid in BTC

{{ site.stars.five }}

TradingView has opened an extraordinary offer for crypto traders to promote their new payment option - Bitcoin. Previously, you were only able to pay your TradingView PRO from Paypal. In February 2019, a BTC payment option was added.

The discount for the crypto payments is fixed in Bitcoin, and so its USD value varies with the BTCUSD ratio.

Through Black Friday 2018, Coinigy offered discounts **up to 75% on annual account subscriptions**.

<b>Start with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinigy.com/?r=4bee056c">Coinigy 30 day free trial</a> and if you like the free tier, upgrade the next Black Friday.</b>

#### Ledger Nano S Black Friday: up to 50% OFF hardware wallets

{{ site.stars.five }}

In 2018, Ledger Wallet opened with the first crypto-related **early bird deal**, 20% off on *Ledger Nano S* ordered between October 17 - October 22.

This campaign was followed on October 31 with a **limited edition Ledger Wallet**, themed for the 10 year anniversary of the Satoshi white-paper.

Through November 2018, Ledger was running a pre-BlackFriday promo for bulk orders on their **special color edition**.

The point of making the most popular cryptocurrency wallet available in 6 different colors was to **make it easier to admin**. With Nano S you can hardly ever use enough wallet apps in a single device, so it has value to be actually able to **tell your hardware wallets apart**.

The bulk offer was quite standard for Ledger:

```
20% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 1 Color Edition
30% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 2 or more Color Edition
```

The early bird offers were finished off with a flat 50% discount on Ledger Nano S.

<b>Remember that with Ledger Nano S, catching them in stock is often an issue. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ledger.com/?r=e274">Take a look at current Ledger Wallet offers</a>.</b>

## Anticipated Crypto Deals for BlackFriday 2019

#### Ledger Nano S Black Friday 2019: Anticipated 50% OFF

{{ site.stars.five }}

Ledger Wallet used to do the Black Friday offer of **21% off on your Ledger Ledger Nano S** but in Black Friday 2018, they released several early-bird offers finishing with a 50% discount.

It is unclear whether that was a one-off event due to the crypto bear market or due to their launch of [Ledger Nano X](http://bit.ly/ledger-nano-x) device in early 2019.

It is expected that due to the increasing competition and also the wider product range at Ledger **the higher discount will repeat for Black Friday 2019**.

## Cryptocurrency Charting & TA Tools

<div id="tradingview"></div>


### TradingView Pro Black Friday Deal

TradingView has yearly Black Friday offer for a limited time where they go down with the subscription price considerably. Depending on your PRO plan, you end up with up to 50% discount.

#### Why go PRO on TradingView

You can keep using TradingView FREE forever but you can only save a one single chart. That means you can only watch one market at a time, nothing like BTCUSD nect to ETHUSD. Additionally, you have no access to intraday spread (looking into arbitrage opportunities between different fiat denominations on shorter timeframes than 1D) and the number of indicators or scripts per chart is limited to 3. That is perhaps bbands, ichimoku cloud and MACD and you cannot even volume color your candles.

With the PRO+ plan you can save 4 layouts and access them from 2 devices, you get 30 server side alerts for either price targets or indicator value targets. You have the allowance of 10 strategies or indicators per chart.

TradingView is the most popular charting and alert tool for cryptocurrency traders to this day. It is reliable, it doesn't take up as much memory as cryptowatch and if you are willing to block 100+ people in the chat, you will find the community stunning. (Just kidding. It's a great charting platform though.)

### Coinigy Black Friday Deal

Coinigy is great for true altcoin traders who want to be the market makers in new markets, who want to leverage arb opportunities and need to stay up to date about opening markets. It is not only a charting engine but also an API interface you can use to access your exchange account without using the crypto exchange web interface, which is usually terrible with the exception of [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC) and [BitMEX](https://www.bitmex.com/register/iYQB44).

Coinigy doesn't charge any additional fee for executing trades via the platform.

The subscription plans prices differ based on the length of your subscription but on Black Friday, you can get a lifetime plan for as little as 3 USD a month. That's pretty much for free, and you get great charting engine, the possibility to trade on multiple exchanges from a single interface and notifications about new markets going live.

## Hardware wallets

<div id="ledger"></div>

### Buy Ledger wallet on Black Friday

Ledger wallet is currently the most trusted hardware wallet for bitcoin and altcoins. The code is fully open source and the Ledger Nano S supports a mass of altcoins, including all ERC20 compliant tokens. Other than Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Zcash, Ethereum and forks, Ledger also supports cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Stratis via Ledger's Companion Apps.

Ledger Nano S also supports Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. Ledger is generally fast and diligent in Bitcoin fork support apps so the Nano S wallet is definitely a good choice if you are a BTC holder and want to be able to split coins safely. (Don't worry if you missed out so far, there will likely be more forks in the future.)

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/e274?path=/products/ledger-nano-s">See crypto supported by Ledger Nano S</a>

Ledger Nano S currently retails at a regular price of **up to 69.90 EUR** (price varies based on your location - the US retail price is still 58 EUR excl. tax). On Black Friday customers get **21% discount** on all Nano S orders. In 2017, the same deal is good for the entire weekend and also the Cyber monday.

<div id="trezor"></div>

### Buy Trezor wallet on Black Friday

Trezor is currently the second most popular hardware wallet for BTC and alternative cryptocurrencies. They lost a bunch of bitcoiner clients due to their unclear messages regarding the BTC forks support. There was also recently a [vulnerability found in Trezor wallets that was patched before it was exploited](https://www.altcointrading.net/trezor-hack). [Learn more about Trezor vs Ledger here](https://www.altcointrading.net/altcoin-wallets/).

Trezor supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Dash, Ethereum and ERC20 via MyEtherWallet.

The regular price of Trezor wallet is 99 USD per device but on Black Friday customers get 20 USD off. Trezors ship via DHL signed parcels and come sealed -- if your seal is damaged, you will get a new device or refund.

SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor, will announce the [2017 deals on their blog](https://blog.trezor.io).
