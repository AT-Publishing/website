The oil shocks and also the recent bombarding that led to a spike (and was mitigated by release from the reserves)
 - it's a commodity perceived as essential (it is part of the daily life and business)
 - the total available supply is unclear, only a relative supply known. It is known that there is less and less of it.
So the price should actually be increasing? If it were just this. (Assuming demand doesn't weaken)
-- but it happens when we see the effects in industry. When there actually are people quing up to buy, it's not just speculation, this is the fundament in action not the speculation. Speculation is to buy expecting the queue.
The shock happens when the effects are different than projected.
Remember that in the first shock, the oil was used as a weapon. (Mention Japan: they have their economy a subject, not just pure mechanical causal response to the shock)
There is no potential, it has to pass the subjective mediation. Even just the base eq shift assumes there will still be some demand. If nobody cares, there is no fundament.
So in our case, we know the supply is decreasing. For the shock to come there needs something else to come by too. Miners need to start hoarding, or some such buyer, or first needs to restrict tx more or become less usable, etc.
So the real effect can well come super late, but it also may come super suddenly.
-- the scramble to a new equilibrium.
This makes DCA relevant again. Also the long term investment post.
(Notes)
- crisis also creates a supply shock as shit biz goes out
- atms and OTC/P2P trends are better metrics for fund because they imply the participation
This importance is the"strong ties" -- they are like family, they form the basis but don't account for breakthroughs. They can at most lead to the death of their possessor once their importance vanished. (Graham Harman)
They contribute to the "birth" of the object, not to it's development or propagation and development.
"We always misunderstand the strength of the strong"
+++ In the most basic way, crypto has a good shot in developing uncertain opportunity and in reclusive rich geeks who do what they want because they have fuck you money.
Eventually, everything turns into it's own caricature, unless it gets symbiosis with new things. -> DCA cohorts are a better fundamental. (There should be consistent higher Vol mid month)
