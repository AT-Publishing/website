## Wrapping Up Wyckoff Range Basics

> Technical Tools & Fundamental Analysis

Simple, basic TA can be very helpful:

* Do the partial run-ups form healthy-looking bull flags?
* Does the range have M/W patterns?
* Do the candles at the bottoms of the retracements have long wicks, indicating strong dip-buying?

Also look for rare formations provided they are reliable -- like widening formations that resemble bull flag which is rare but it indicates good bullish momentum:

> Fundamental value of the asset

It would not be Wyckoff if there wasn't some fundamental pickiness about what to actually trade. Indeed, **fundamental analysis** cannot be completely discounted here.

In crypto, fundamentals can seem problematic though:
* The [valuation of most altcoins](/value/) is based on future expectation rather than any kind of present utility.
* Altcoiners however will say the same about bitcoin, argumenting that not many people use it for actual payments.

The real fundamental data for big cryptocurrencies exist though.

Look at the following metrics:

* Bitcoin network activity
* Daily transaction counts
* Total number of ATMs
* P2P exchange data
* Darknet markets usage

At the end of the distribution phase, it is fair to be caustiously leaning bullish on the base of strong fundamentals.

At the end of a bull run, it is to be expected that the (fundamentally) strongest asset will start it's decline as the last one.

> How to trade a ranging market in general?

* **Short-Term:** Look for bounds of the inner ranges and formations and scalp them.
* **Long-Term:** Prepare to take substantial position at important points. Determine the "doom" bottom and set buys or the "upthrust" and set sells.

* Short Term: Formation targets

If you are trading flags, channels, megafones and triangles, the height of these usually provides a short term target within the range.

* Short/Mid Term: SCMR (Blue candle magic)

One of the very popular (paid) technical analysis suites for TradingView has been [the SCMR](https://www.tradingview.com/market/sc-spydercrusher/). It provides the elusive colored candles - blue candle signifying a bullish shift in volume, suggesting bottom is near. Another popular feature are the dynamic levels which are basically better pivot lines. Traders use these very successfully.

* Mid/Long-Term: Point & Figure

PnF charts are whole another magic. If you trade BTCUSD and don't know PnF, stop by to the r/bitcoinmarkets Daily to search for posts by [u/merlin560](https://www.reddit.com/user/merlin560) and [u/joyrider5](https://www.reddit.com/user/joyrider5) who post PnF summary regularly.

* Mid/Long-Term: Fibonacci retracement

It's anyone's guess if the Fibonacci retracement stuff fundamentally makes sense but in 2017 most traders still use fibs to determine their targets, especially in a bull run that keeps reaching new ATHs where there is no previous data to draw resistance lines from. Some people do use simple pivots, but it seems that Fibs are still the most prevalent -- which, if nothing else, makes them valid.

* How to draw fibs from a correction/markdown

The correct way to draw Fibonacci retracement lines for a currection or a markdown is to start from the swing high and drag the fib all the way to the swing low. This way you get to where to the north the market can reach in recovery from the correction.

You can get a fib retracement from a corrective range too - drag from its high to its low on the timeframe where you see the range. It's far from a bad idea to have several fib structures one over another to see which fib levels coincide.

Cryptocurrencies seem to be particularly fond of the following fib extension levels: 1, 1.618, 2.618, 4.236. These are the ones that you need to have ticked in your TradingView settings as a minimum.

* How to draw fibs from a runup

If you want to see how far the market will correct from a runup, you do the opposite: start drawing the fib from the bottom to the high.

Fibonacci levels can provide longer term and swing targets if you use them on higher timeframes, even targets that will contain multiple ranges.
