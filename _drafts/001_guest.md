How to get passive income on your crypto holdings?

There are numerous ways to make real money on cryptocurrencies. If you want to try but do not know how to do it, keep reading for a short list below. You will get familiar with the most popular and interesting methods of getting passive income on your crypto holdings.

HODL

This is the simplest method ever – you do not need to do much to get some extra income. The only thing you have to do is find some good and reliable cryptocurrencies that pay dividends regularly and hold them in your wallet. By good and reliable cryptocurrencies, I mean the ones that have good fundamentals and a use case showing that its value has been going up over a period of time. Once you find cryptocurrencies you want to hold in your wallet you should keep them between 6 months and 2 years (approximately) and take out your principal amount from the profits.

Lending

If you have significant Bitcoins (or Ether, or any other cryptocurrency) you can lend it to people who will pay you some extra interest. There are various [lending platforms](https://www.cryptocoinzone.com/bitcoin-lending/) where you can do this. The most popular one is Ethlend where you can lend approximately 250 tokens. There are also margin funding options for major coins (option offered at Bitfinex, Bitmex, Poloniex etc.). For the lazy people who do not want to manually manage all lending stuff, crypto lending bots have been brought to life. A lending bot will take care of it for you with a small fee. You should always take a look at some reviews before you start using any platform using pages like e.g. Cryptocoinzone, so go on and check their  Cryptocurrency Lending  page to find your favourite platform.

Masternodes

Masternode is simply a computer wallet (or a cryptocurrency full node) that keeps the full copy of the blockchain in real time (it kind of supports the network by hosting a copy of the coin’s ledger). It is always up and running and does some special tasks in certain cryptocurrencies. You, the masternode owner, can be compensated for your masternode doing these tasks. Keep in mind that most projects have different numbers of coins as a

minimum to start running masternodes. Also, the requirement of being up and running 24/7 might be a bit discouraging.

Staking

Staking might be the easiest way to get some extra income on cryptocurrencies you hold. However, in order to be able to start staking, your coins have to follow the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism (this is the only way for stakers to be rewarded and the blockchain to be secured at the same time). If you own the proof-of-stake coins, you just keep them in an open wallet to generate new similar coins. No effort included. You can have approximately 10% extra coins in a year by just holding and staking them. It is like a regular dividend or profit on your cryptocurrencies.

Mining

Be aware that mining the most popular coins (like Bitcoin) is difficult. Mining is usually the most profitable if you are a big player but if you have cheap electricity and a decent gaming PC you still can make some profit on it. However, you will have to prepare a very powerful equipment like GPU rigs and some cooling stuff. Entry barriers are serious, so mining is usually limited to mining farms and professionals. There are also some cloud mining services but when you look into their terms of use you will quickly notice you will not make a single penny on it.
