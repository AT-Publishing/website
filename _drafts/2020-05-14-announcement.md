Hello there. Happy belated halvening.

This is just to announce a couple of new things to those who might not [subscribe](http://eepurl.com/cOgd6P) to all the feeds.

## New Trading Strategy post published on 14th May.

It's a long read on technical analysis in crypto. Basically, it explains that you can use TA strategically, as opposed to blindly.

There are plenty examples to illustrate all points and technical terms link to relevant articles here on the website.

A list of good tools is included, again with illustrations on how to use them well.

It is a 'mindset' post, though. You will have to actually sit down and do some charting, try stuff and so on. This will just give you the right direction.

## New glossary section

If you haven't notices yet, we have a glossary of terms that the crypto newcomers probably don't know and that, in some cases, cannot really be googled.

Or, they can, but the search might go kinda sideways.
