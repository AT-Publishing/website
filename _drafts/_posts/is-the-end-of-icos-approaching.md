A lot has changed since [the last post on ICOs](https://www.altcointrading.net/ico-2016/) in summer 2016.

### Lawmakers have noticed

There has been a post on 2nd May 2017 at law111 and elsewhere that caught the attention of the crypto community. To be honest, it was an interesting thing for some die hard bitcoiners since they started projecting the EndOfEtherium&trade; - the ICOs will get regulated, there will be no reason to buy ETH anymore, ETH will collapse and BTC will get it's market cap share back. It is a bit too far out there, nonetheless there seem to be regulations in the making. The [post on law111](https://www.law111.com/11state-lawmakers-increasing-their-focus-on-vc-and-blockchain-technology) says: 

> In early 2017, multiple state legislatures have taken action reflecting their recognition of the potential impact of virtual currency and blockchain technology. These actions have ranged from requests for further information regarding the technology to an active debate regarding a specific use case.

...continuing with a state-by-state US legislations. 

In a more human readable form, this was discussed at [crowdfundinginsider.com](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2017/03/96598-initial-coin-offering-probably-regulated-securities-law/) in March already:

> For those of you not familiar with what ICOs are, here’s a quick summary. Lots of folks working in the blockchain world needed money to fund their project or startup. So they decided to invent their own “coin” variant and sold those coins to fund their project/startup, in exchange for some financial upside in the project.

> Sound familiar? That’s because it is. This is the story of every capital-hungry startup/business/entrepreneur.

> I’ve heard ICOs described as a “donation with financial upside” or “crowdsale” (whatever that is), and a number of other things—to try to avoid securities laws. First of all, a donation is a donation— you’re giving away money (or bitcoin), and there is no financial upside to a donation. A “crowdsale” of tokens—to the extent those “tokens” represent securities—is still a security. There are a number of different things that ICOs are doing, so it’s difficult to address the entire industry in one article, but let me impart some guidance to make this easier to understand: If walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, its probably a duck.

The penalty for such offense is a fine and restriction for the person that was the head of the enterprise - they cannot be a chief executive of any company again. This is supposed to mean the end of the person's career. 

What is it actually for? Well, the founder of the 

First thing, however, the article goes on to say it will take the regulators a while to figure out how to deal with the very new thing an ICO is. 
Many people who had done ICOs before are certainly safe. There is several hundreds of crypto tokens by now. Some of them were funded by pseudonymous identities and the project that was backing them doesn't exist anymore. Nobody will ever know. 
Wait...is there a way this could possible be done in the future too?
