#### What's Peerplays

Peerplays aim to work as a betting platform. Because it's on the blockchain, it will be available from all countries. Users place a bet, the bet is processed on the blockchain (it's a dapp), profits are distributed via PPY - the Peerplays profit sharing tokens.

It is an interesting concept, except the red flag that comes with everything that is *the UBER of [industry]*:

> “Peerplays will eliminate the need for traditional bookies in their sports betting.”

There is this problem with people who keep coming back to estabilished bookies because everyone keeps coming back to estabilished bookies. Peerplays would require people to trust a dapp and it would require them to work with a dapp, that's two new things. But who knows. The Bookie app that would enable betting 

But this is what everyone likes to hear preferentially these days, or so it seems: Peerplays is a divident paying token. 

> Peerplays Makes HODLing Profitable with Automatic Fee-Sharing Distributions: “Peerplays is aiming to be the first truly Decentralized Autonomous Cooperative (DAC) [...] With this new profit sharing module, all the **fees that Peerplays charges** for smart contract operations and peer-to-peer wagering will be **distributed directly to the holders of the core Peerplays blockchain tokens**, just like a traditional co-op pays **dividends to its shareholders**.” [- via steem](https://steemit.com/peerplays/@cryptoprometheus/peerplays-makes-hodling-profitable-with-automatic-fee-sharing-distributions)
