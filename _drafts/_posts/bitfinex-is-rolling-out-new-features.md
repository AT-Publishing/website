[Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC) was rolling out new features on 10th of May 2017 in the afternoon which probably logged you off temporarily, if you were trading at that moment.

From [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basket.asp):

> A basket is a single unit of at least 15 stocks that are used in program trading, index fund management and currency portfolio management.

> A basket option ... A sample of such is index options where in different stocks have been compiled together as an index. Instead of basing the price of the index on particular stocks, they are based on the average of the index’ underlying assets’ weighted sum and average.

There has been this number available for a set of altcoins on [data.altcointrading.net](https://data.altcointrading.net/#/), explained [here](https://data.altcointrading.net/how/). 

```
Altindex is calculated volume-weighted average 
BTC price of a set of altcoins:
["ethereum", "ethereum-classic", "dash", "monero",
 "litecoin", "augur", "factom", "zcash", "ripple" ]
```

It's a very useful thing if you want to monitor which altcoin pairs perform well and which altcoin pairs are laggards. In this way, you can make more informed desicions regarding your short term trades. [Read the article on Wyckoff avoidance strategy here](https://www.altcointrading.net/wyckoff-avoidance/).

The most valuable information you want if you are actively trading is not the absolute price of a pair versus the index but the price changes. Here in the realm of cryptocurrencies you see that XMRBTC these days reacts only weakly and with a delay compared to ETHBTC. If you care about the most short term profit during an altcoin surge and the situation is the way just described, you should focus on ETH.
