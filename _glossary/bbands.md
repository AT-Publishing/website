#### Best Markets for BBands

Bollinger bands are often used on forex markets, aside from crypto markets. They work well on markets that trade in pairs, such as currencies.

The reason for this fit is the fact that **bbands are in fact a moving average with two standard deviations on either side**.

Which means the information bbands are giving you when the price action ventures out of them is basically: *"this ratio shot up a bit more then usuall - it might shoot back some time soon, but then it also might not"*.

And so, now you can hopefully stop treating John Bollinger like a demi-god.
