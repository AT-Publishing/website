BBands is the abbreviation for Bollinger Bands&trade;, a popular technical indicator.

Bollinger bands are often used on forex markets, aside from crypto markets. They work well on markets that trade in pairs, such as currencies.

The reason for this is the fact that bbands are basically a moving average with two standard deviations on either side. Which means the information bbands are giving you when the price action ventures out of them is basically: "this ratio shot up a bit more then usuall - it might shoot back now but then it also might not".

And now you can hopefully stop treating John Bollinger like a demi-god.
