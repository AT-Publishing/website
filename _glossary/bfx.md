### About Bitfinex Trading Platform


#### About Bitfinex

Bitfinex is a custodial crypto trading platform that provides spot trading, leveraged trading and crypto futures trading.

The company that owns Bitfinex also runs a noncustodial trading platform [DeversiFi](/coupon-bitfinex-5egv78ytlc/#deversifi).

The Bitfinex platform caters towards active traders. It has a full featured interface with all you need for [daytrading](/daytrading/) spot or futures market in crypto, and the same data-rich UI for the lending market.

On the other hand, Bitfinex doesn't provide as high leverage as [BitMEX](/coupon-bitmex-iyqb44/) and is *not* focused primarily on derivatives, which means the crowd on Bitfinex is less focused on very short-term speculation. Margin cascades are rare.

The user interface on Bitfinex has embedded charts from [TradingView PRO](https://bit.ly/at-tvd-btcusd).
