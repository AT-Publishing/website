In trading jargon, **ATH** stands for **All-Time High**.

A market makes a new all-time high if its price action rises above the previous all-time maximum price. There is no other requirement for timeframe, [patterns](/glossary/pattern-trading/) or any special [technical setup](/technical-analysis/). Even if the market retraces abruptly, the new ATH still counts.

### The Bitcoin ATH

On the bitcoin-dollar market, an ATH will happen when the price rises to anywhere over 20k USD.

### ATH jargon term

ATH is a term that you will find used in legacy trading as well, it is not specific to crypto.
