In crypto jargon, **SFYL** is short for **Sorry for your loss**.

Sometimes, you will see the **SFHL** version, which stands for **Sorry for his/her loss**.

<!--more-->

Within the crypto community, the SFYL phrase has been coined on the `r/buttcoin` Reddit forum. Buttcoin is an old (and still active) forum for people who think that cryptocurrencies are a joke.

Originally, they would repost comments and posts about people investing in BTC and commenting with "SFYL".

Over time this understandably lost most of its relevancy, but the phrase kept being used in other contexts within the crypto community.
