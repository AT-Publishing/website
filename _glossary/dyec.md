In crypto trading jargon, **DYEC** is short for **do you even chart**.

DYEC is a variation on the famous DYEL exclamation from online fitness communities (Do You Even Lift?) which is posted **when someone gives bad advice** or talks down to others while making it obvious they don't know what they're talking about.

In crypto communities, DYEC is a valid response when someone posts bad [technical analysis](/technical-analysis/), which is something that happens a lot in very popular communities such as [TradingView](http://bit.ly/at-tvd-eth).

By calling out bad [TA](/glossary/ta/) you either get something to brag about on the internet (more common on Reddit), or you'll get totally hammered by super loyal fanboi ultras (more common on Twitter).
