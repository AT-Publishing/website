Footprint trading is an advanced trading technique used on both cryptocurrency and legacy markets.

The benefits of footprint trading are more pronounced in short-term speculation techniques, such as [scalping](/strategy/scalping/).

#### Footprint Charting

Footprint charting is a way of plotting the price action to get the so-called "footprint" within a candle.

The footprint is essentially a **histogram** that plots the volume traded at each price segment of a candle. A candle footprint chart could look like this:

Usually, the display is done in a way that is easier to look at, such as by coloring segments of the candle with different levels of intensity:

#### Tools for footprint trading in crypto

* **[Tensorcharts](http://bit.ly/dont-be-an-amateur)** was the original charting app that was the first to provide footprint charting for crypto. Footprint is available in paid plans. ([More on TensorCharts](/tensorcharts/))
* **[Tradingview](http://bit.ly/at-tvd-eth)** currently does not provide footprint charting, but it is [going to be added as a feature to Tradingview paid plans soon](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/350#issuecomment-590759521).
