#### "Moon" in mainstream media

[October 2020 Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2020/10/25/paypals-bitcoin-strategy-is-not-about-bitcoin/#4c1b531878d7) analysing Paypal's Bitcoin strategy casually mentions the expectation of the "moon":

#### Beware of The "ToTheMoonGuy"

The legend has it the top is near once `u/tothemoonguy` gets gilded.
