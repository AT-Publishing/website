 name:      "Hodling"

In crypto jargon, we say **hodl** instead of "hold", as in "hold crypto".

The term "hodl" is **not** an acronym but a drunk misspelling of "hold".

### Original HODL Post

Hodl is a misspelling of "hold" that comes from a now legendary bitcointalk.org post made in 2013 by a drunk OP.

In the hodl's original post (below), OP is lamenting he did not sell his BTC before a price decline to rebuy at the bottom. He explains he's not a good trader and therefore makes a public commitment to hodling.

Hodl therefore does not stand for 'hold on for dear life', but the idea is pretty similar to that.
