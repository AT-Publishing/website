In trading jargon, **VPVR** means **volume profile visible range**.

VPVR is a charting device used in volume trading. Volume trading is a popular technique in cryptocurrency trading.

<!--more-->

### What is VPVR

VPVR stands for volume profile visible range.

VPVR plots a histogram over one side of the chart that reveals the price levels with *most traded volume* in your currently *visible range* of the market.

Identifying the areas where high volume of trading happened brings you close to identifying areas of supply and demand.

### Where to trade volume profile visible range

VPVR is marketed as an advanced tool. It is not that volume trading would be difficult to understand, but that VP gives real, granular market data. Your usual volume TA tools like [OBV](/scriptspotlight-obv-div/) give you averaged, statistical data.

If you want rich, granular data like VPVR, you'll have to pay for it.
