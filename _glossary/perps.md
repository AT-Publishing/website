In the crypto trader jargon, **perps** is short for **perpetual contract** or **perpetual swap**, a popular derivative product intruduced by [BitMEX trading platform](http://bit.ly/2Muo11z). Similar product is now traded also on OKEx and elsewhere.

The perpetual contract is derivative product like a future contract, but there is no expiration date. Therefore you will not get the futures-specific behavior near the expiration date, the perpetual contract behaves more like spot market.

The most obvious difference for you as a crypto trader is that to long a BTCUSD perpetual contract, you deposit crypto, whereas on spot market you would need USD to long a BTCUSD market.

### Who are perps for?

If you are speculating short term and interested in getting your profit in crypto, perps will do a better job than margin trading the fiat pair as they pay out directly in crypto.

If you want to long in the sense of [buy and hold](/glossary/lth/), do it on the spot market for fiat money.
