We distinguish *regular divergence*, *hidden divergence* and *exaggerated divergence*.

*Regular Divergence* is a sign of trend reversal. Price keeps the trend but indicator already shows the reversal.

* Signal to **short** = regular divergence in **tops**. Price makes higher high but oscillator makes lower high. Underlying weakness, possible exhaustion at the end of a bull trend.
* Signal to **long** = regular divergence in **bottoms**. Price makes lower low but oscillator makes higher low. Underlying strength, possible bottoming in progress.

*Hidden Divergence* is a divergence that follows the trend. Hidden divs show the market is inclined to continue the current trend.

* Signal to **short** = hidden divergence in **tops**. Price makes lower highs but oscillator makes higher highs. Tends to be found on lower highs in a downtrend.
* Signal to **long** = hidden divergence in **bottoms**. Price makes higher low but oscillator makes lower low. Tends to be found during continuation pauses in an uptrend.

*Exaggerated Divergence* is only different in that price makes double top or double bottom rather than new high or new low.

Divergence itself is not a strong enough signal to trigger a trading decision about entry or exit.
