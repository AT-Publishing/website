In the crypto trader jargon, BGD is short for "big green dildo". BGD is a large green candle painted at some substantial timeframe (4H, 1D).

#### What is a valid BGD?

BGD must be noticeably big candle on a timeframe of at least 3H or 4H.

Calling a BGD on a short timeframe chart (such as 5M or 30M) will typically result in prompts to "zoom out", which is to consider the bigger picture by switching to a longer timeframe chart before reacting sensationally.

#### Opposite of BGD

The opposite of BGD is a "Big Red Dildo", BRD, a big red candle on a longer timeframe chart.

#### Alernative names for BGD

Some cryptocurrency traders may also call a BGD the "Jesus candle" and BRD the "Judas candle".
