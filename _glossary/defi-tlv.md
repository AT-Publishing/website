**What is TLV**: In DeFi slang, TLV is short for Total Locked Value, a [yield farming](/glossary/yield-farming/) market metric.

The **total locked value** shows the total liquidity locked up in a DeFi contract.

TLV measures its health and also the market share of that project.

Transparency of the project team can be used as a sort of metric too, DeFi is an unregulated field and scams are abundant.
