**Volume trading** is a popular technique in cryptocurrency trading.

Volume trading is not particular to crypto markets, it is used on legacy markets as well.

### Volume Profile Strategies

Broadly, volume trading is any trading technique that takes into account changes in traded volume on a market.

On crypto trading forums, when someone talks about *volume trading*, it will be *volume profile trading*.

Volume trading strategies that spread the most include:

* **Volume support/resistance**: Price levels where very high volume was traded will in the future form the base of [ranges](/glossary/sideways/). Evidently these are areas where a lot of the asset changed hands, so they can be considered support/resistance levels.
* **Filling the gap**: If the price action went fast on a very thin volume, the theory says the price will throw back to the volume support and "fill the gap".
* **Volume vs price change**: If the price moves a lot on a thin volume, the sustainability of the action is questioned. This situation can paint the [Bart Simpson pattern](/glossary/bart/).

### Popular tools for Volume Trading

There are several technical analysis tools and devices that crypto traders like to use for volume trading.

The most popular volume trading indicators:

* **VPVR**, or [volume profile visible range](/glossary/vpvr/), gives granular data
* **OBV**, or [on balance volume](/scriptspotlight-obv-div/), gives averaged-out data
* Charting apps like footprint charts or [Tensorcharts](/tensorcharts/) work with volume profile within a candle
