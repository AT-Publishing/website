<h3 id="trading-is-not-for-everyone">Trading Is Not For Everyone</h3>

<p>And it’s not <em>just</em> that crypto trading is not for everyone.</p>

<p>Even if you have enough skill or edge to trade, very often there is just not a good opportunity to open a trade.</p>

<p>The market is choppy, there are stop hunts, the volume is too thin.</p>

<p>So then, <strong>can you profit from your crypto holdings even if you don’t want to trade?</strong></p>

<p>The answer is you can with a basic crypto strategy, but be warned. For the most part it requires you to be ultra-longterm bullish on crypto.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the options you have.</p>

<h3 id="1-build-a-hodl-strategy">1/ Build a “hodl” strategy</h3>

<p>This is the simplest method ever.</p>

<p>The “buy and hold” strategy is the staple of retail legacy finance as well. In crypto, the idea is the same, except you apply it on a cryptoasset instead of on a stock.</p>

<p>Oh, and we call it <a href="/glossary/#hodl-hodling">“hodl”</a> in crypto, not “hold”.</p>

<h4 id="beginner-hodl-crypto-strategy">Beginner HODL Crypto Strategy</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Find a crypto with good fundamentals: <strong>network effect, resistance to bad news, a use case</strong> showing that it’s more than a vaporware.</li>
  <li>Once you find cryptocurrencies you want to keep, decide on how long you are willing to hold them. Ballpark is good enough: <strong>A decade? A year?</strong></li>
  <li>Split that period and make a mental note on <strong>how often you will re-evaluate</strong> your investment. You can go with seasonal cycles, as long as they are relevant. Crypto traders all week all year, but there are seasonal things like <strong>the halving cycle</strong> of Bitcoin.</li>
  <li>Every time your point of re-evaluation comes, you can decide to rebalance and take out some amount from your profits, or to cut your losses, or to just keep holding everything.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are wondering about how much to invest and how to pick the best time to buy - that’s already speculation. If you are a beginner, you will do best with DCA, which is dollar cost averaging.</p>

<h4 id="your-toolbox">Your Toolbox</h4>

<p>To execute a beginner HODL strategy, you will probably need some of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Skim through our <a href="/how-to-buy-altcoins/">Guide on Buying Altcoins</a> - with KYC, with no KYC.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/coupon-independent-reserve/">Recommended crypto exchange to buy From is Independent Reserve</a>, if you go the KYC route.</li>
      <li><a href="/how-to-buy-altcoins/#fiat-anon">Recommended non-KYC place to buy from is LocalCryptos</a>, the P2P marketplace for crypto.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Get the basics of <a href="/strategy/dollar-cost-averaging/">Dollar Cost Averaging</a>. For a true beginner strategy you will want to avoid price speculation. Too many people fall into the trap of “I will buy when it drops” and never get started.
    <ul>
      <li>Two places where you can easily automate your regular purchases are <a href="/coupon-independent-reserve/">Independent Reserve</a> (real crypto) and the <a href="/howto/revolut-recurring-buy/">Revolut App</a> (investing vehicle only, impossible to withdraw).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="/altcoin-wallets/">Get a good crypto wallet</a>, that’s where you will hodl your coin. The commercial ones get <a href="/blackfriday/">on sale a few times a year</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-crypto-lending">2/ Crypto Lending</h3>

<p>If you have more than a tiny amount of Bitcoins (or Ether, or any other cryptocurrency that is traded on custodial exchanges), you can lend it to traders on most exchanges that run margin trading.</p>

<p>You will earn interest in cryptocurrency directly into your exchange wallet.</p>

<p>The best trading platform to do that is <a href="/coupon-bitfinex-5egv78ytlc/">Bitfinex, thanks to their new Lending PRO interface</a>.</p>

<h4 id="beginner-crypto-lending-strategy">Beginner Crypto Lending Strategy</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up at an exchange that does margin lending. <a href="http://bit.ly/bfx-vid">This is a link to Bitfinex, there you go</a>.</li>
  <li>Decide on the size of your lending stack. All your wallet’s contents? Part of it? It’s up to you.
    <ul>
      <li>Lending itself has next to no risk, but the platform through which you lend may get hacked.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Decide what is the lowest acceptable rate for you. A good one is a daily rate of 0.03 which gives you 10% return per year.</li>
  <li>Monitor the daily rates. If the rates increase, lend all your stack! If the rates get below your threshold, lend less and take the rest out into your crypto wallet.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="your-toolbox-1">Your Toolbox</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Margin Lending</strong>: Full template and formulas for your interest rates calculation can be found in <a href="/strategy/cryptocurrency-lending/">ATNET Strategy on Lending</a></li>
  <li><strong>Other options</strong>: <a href="https://www.cryptocoinzone.com/bitcoin-lending/">Lending platforms</a> like Ethlend, where you can lend a range of some 250 ERC-20 tokens.</li>
  <li><strong>Automation</strong>: If you don’t want to manually manage the lending rates, a crypto lending bot can take care of it either for free or for a fee. The <a href="http://bit.ly/34Zampi">platform 3commas</a> offers easily configurable crypto trading bots.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-run-a-masternode">3/ Run a Masternode</h3>

<p>With masternode management we are getting into the territory of strategies that are simple to pull of, but they require upfront investment.</p>

<p>Masternode is a cryptocurrency full node with a wallet that keeps the full copy of the blockchain. By that it supports the coin’s network.</p>

<p>A masternode must be always up and running and is required to perform certain tasks for the cryptocurrency network. You as the masternode owner get a payout in your node’s currency as a compensation for this.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, running a masternode also requires an upfront investment.</p>

<p>You will need to buy the node’s currency and hold it in the node wallet as a minimum to start running your node as a masternode.</p>

<p>Obviously you don’t want to be stuck with a shitcoin. Make sure you do your proper <a href="/value/">due diligence and judge the coin’s value carefully</a>.</p>

<h3 id="4-staking">4/ Staking</h3>

<p>Staking might be the easiest way to get extra income on a cryptocurrencies you hold. Clearly, as with masternode management, you need to hold the crypto in question.</p>

<p>Our note about <a href="/value/">value judgement</a> is just as relevant here.</p>

<p>Once you decided a currency has value for the long run, staking requires no strategy or evaluation - you are primarily collecting more of the coin.</p>

<h4 id="you-can-stake-even-og-cryptos">You can stake even OG cryptos</h4>

<p>In order to stake a cryptocurrency, it has to follow the <em>proof-of-stake</em> consensus mechanism.</p>

<p>But in 2020, there are variations of “wrapped” cryptocurrencies. That means you can also stake bitcoin in its wrapped form, or even a fiat currency.</p>

<h4 id="staking-is-not-too-profitable">Staking is not too profitable</h4>

<p>In the past you could earn up to 10% extra coins in a year by just holding and staking them. As the barrier to start staking gradually became lower, the earnings also decreased.</p>

<p>As of 2020, for the more mainstream cryptocurrencies you will earn better by lending them via margin funding.</p>

<p>If you still want to do it…</p>

<h4 id="your-toolbox-2">Your Toolbox</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The crypto trading platform Kraken is one of the most legit places that lets you do that.</li>
  <li>If you prefer non-KYC platforms, <a href="http://bit.ly/catch-me-if-ya-can">Bitfinex</a> lets you stake automatically after depositing a stakeable cryptocurrency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-mining-and-other-early-opportunities-bounties-rebates-cashback">5/ Mining and other early opportunities: Bounties, Rebates, Cashback…</h3>

<p>In 2020, mining of the most popular proof-of-work coins (like Bitcoin) is a lost case unless you are in special circumstances.</p>

<p>These days, mining is only really profitable if you are a big player, if you have cheap electricity and special equipment.</p>

<p>If you have mining rigs and cooling stuff left over from when small scale Bitcoin mining still paid off, you can still make some money with that on the altcoin markets.</p>

<p>There are new proof-of-work cryptocurrencies getting launched all the time. With new coins you can get into mining early when it’s easy and pays well.</p>

<p>Here on ATNET we alert you on these opportunities through our <a href="/airdrops/">Crypto Airdrops</a> page.</p>
