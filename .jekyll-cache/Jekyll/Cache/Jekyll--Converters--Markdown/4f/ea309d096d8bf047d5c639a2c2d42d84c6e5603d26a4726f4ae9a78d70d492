I"½<p>Quite briefly: The year 2017 is coming to a close and everyone is publishing â€˜top 10 altcoin picksâ€™ for the next year as if there was only tomorrow and no yesterday. Here is a list of all altcoins that were launched during 2017 - taken from <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/new-cryptocurrencies-2017.html">bitinfocharts</a> on 19th of December - <a href="http://archive.is/TQjvW">archive link</a>. They are ordered by that days trading volume in USD and there are some remarks to the top 20 of them. Youâ€™ll have some info about the platform these are on, what is their value proposition and how tradeable they are. And youâ€™ll see the list is very consistent with the fleeting mentality of the markets - since pretty much everything is just speculative most volume are getting the relatively new coins which happen to be the ones that donâ€™t really do TA (yet?). The coins that were the rage half a year ago are kind of forgotten - with the exception of bitcoin forks.</p>
