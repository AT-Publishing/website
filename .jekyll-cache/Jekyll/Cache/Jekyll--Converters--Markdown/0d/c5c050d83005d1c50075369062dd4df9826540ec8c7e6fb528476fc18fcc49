<p>Billfodl is next to Cryptosteel one of the leaders in true cold storage for crypto - producer of the super resistant metal private key storage for the paranoid.</p>

<p>Billfodl is made 100% of the highest quality 316 stainless steel that has super high melting point (to withstand house fires), is very resistant to corrosion (even in salt water) and also completely shock-proof (to withstand explosions). Very good for your cold storage coins that never move.</p>

<p>They also have bundle packs in case you are ultra paranoid and want to split your main money seed in two to store it in two different locations.</p>

<p>Billfodl wallets ship from the US but only show prices before tax on their e-shop, if you’re elsewhere you might need to add the duties to your bill.</p>
