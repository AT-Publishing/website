I"+<p>In technical analysis, <strong>TK Cross</strong> refers to a crossover of the Tenken and Kinjun lines (<strong>TK lines</strong>) of the <a href="/glossary/ichimoku/">Ichimoku Cloud</a> indicator.</p>

<p>The TK lines are sometimes called the <strong>balance lines</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="tk-cross-trading-strategies">TK Cross Trading Strategies</h4>

<p>The TK lines, or Tenken and Kinjun, are fast and slow moving averages.</p>

<p>As with any kind of moving averages, traders will look for their crossover to look for a potential trend reversal.</p>

<p>Another option is to read TK lines as an overbought/oversold indicator.</p>

<p>If the price action sticks around them, it signals that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold.</p>

<p>Conversely, if the price action travels very far from TK lines, it means the market is way out of balance.</p>

<p>In this situation a pullback is likely, but it is by itself not a trigger to open a position for the pullback - you should look to other indicators to confirm that. It is roughly comparable to the situation where the price overshoots outside of <a href="/glossary/bbands/">bbands</a>.</p>

<p>In more stable markets or in <a href="/glossary/sideways/">sideways</a> periods, price stays around these lines and traders watch how it is bouncing off them or crossing them when they are looking for a good entry.</p>
