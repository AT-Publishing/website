I"0<p>“Squishy” is a crypto jargon for the <strong>bearish MACD crossover</strong> specifically on the 3D timeframe.</p>

<p>This long timeframe MACD cross has its own name because it happens fairly rarely and reliably results in a prolonged downturn on the market.</p>

<p>In general, long timeframe MACD cross is not the best indicator to trigger a short position before the cross has fully happened and laster over a full trading session. It is certainly not a good idea to sell once the two lines of MACD start closing in on each other, looking like they are about to cross in a few sessions: What MACD often does is it will paint this potential soon-to-cross but later the lines will “bounce”, as in diverge from one another again.</p>

<p>The best approach is to take squishy as the signal to pay attention and look for more precise indications before triggering a trade.</p>
