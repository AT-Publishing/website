I"‡<p>In crypto, <strong>Moonmath</strong> is a half-joke prediction model for future Bitcoin price based on past performance.</p>

<p>The basic Moonmath table projects a price development starting from a certain past timespan. It tells you on which future date the price of Bitcoin will reach one million dollars, should the trend of the selected timeframe continue.

<p>Moonmath is available at <a href="https://www.moonmath.win/">moonmath.win</a>, a website developed and maintained by Redditor u/jarederaj.</p>

<h4 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h4>

<p>Moonmath exists just for fun, but since every crypto-related website has to disclaim that its contents are just for fun due to financial regulations, it is worth explaining why Moonmath <em>actually</em> exists just for fun.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moonmath uses a mathematical model that projects future performance based off past performance. This idea is extremely unreliable in general.</li>
  <li>The projection that Moonmath gives is too linear. It predicts a slow, steady price action which is not the reality of <a href="/blog/trading/">cryptocurrency trading</a> at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since its inception, the Moonmath website started hosting other price projection tools that are to be taken seriously since they are more reliable in nature.</p>

  <li><strong>Supertâ€™s Bitcoin price projection based off network activity</strong> which is actually a very good approach to assess a <a href="/pow-fundamentals/">cryptoâ€™s fundamentals</a>.
