I"Ø<p>In crypto jargon, <strong>P2P</strong> is short for <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> or <strong>person-to-person</strong> and usually refers to a way of purchasing cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>If you purchase crypto in a P2P way, you do that directly with a counterparty; without the participation of a service provider such an exchange platform. You may have used a platform to find that counterparty, but your transaction happens between your cryptocurrency wallet and the wallet of your counterparty.</p>

<p>To people who are new or just onramping to crypto, the term P2P often sounds synonymous with <em>private</em>, <em>anonymous</em> or <em>untraceable</em>.</p>

<p>That is not true.</p>

<p>A case in point is the P2P market <a href="/glossary/lbc/">LBC</a> which was forced to submit tradersâ€™ identities to government forces due to the marketplaceâ€™s code structure which was way too simple.</p>

<h4 id="why-you-should-not-use-localbitcoins">Why You Should Not Use Localbitcoins</h4>

<p>LBC, and many other P2P trading platforms, are basically an online forum where people post offers for others to look up. To sell cryptocurrency, you need to fund a wallet that belongs to LBC from <em>your own wallet</em>. To buy a cryptocurrency, you need to withdraw your crypto from a wallet that belongs to LBC to <em>your own wallet</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to that, <a href="/glossary/lbc/">LBC</a> still has access to all the direct messages between counterparties. It is very common that a seller of cryptocurrency will require you to DM a scan of your document to see if your bank account or Paypal matches it.</p>

<p>To government agencies, this provides a direct link between <em>your cryptocurrency wallet</em> and your bank account.</p>

<h4 id="p2p-and-private-look-for-zero-knowledge">P2P and Private: Look For Zero Knowledge</h4>

<p>Platform called <a href="https://bit.ly/2YD6gmA">LocalCryptos</a> is where itâ€™s at in 2020.</p>

<ul>
  <li>LocalCryptos are not related to LocalBitcoins.</li>
</ul>

<p>The LocalCryptos platform is a dApp running on <strong>Ethereum smart contracts and Bitcoin scripts</strong>.</p>

<p>You get your private key on sign up, which you <a href="/security/backups/">must back up</a> because the marketplace is <strong>fully zero-knowledge and fully non-custodial</strong>. The platform is not a counterparty to any transaction and they do not have access to DMs communicated between traders as these are end to end encrypted.</p>

<p>The founder of LocalCryptos has <a href="/localcryptos-interview/">strong political opinions and is not shy to share them</a>.</p>
