I"É<p><a href="http://www.altcoin.io?kid=KHPDT">Altcoin.io</a> is a very promising decentralized exchange project with <strong>no ICO or VC funding backing it</strong>. The list of people involved can be found <a href="http://www.altcoin.io?kid=KHPDT">right on their homepage</a> and includes some familiar names and handles - <a href="https://medium.com/@cryptocoinrun">Coinrun</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mBTCPizpie">Pizpie</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/carpenoctom/featured">Josh Olszewicz</a>.</p>

<p>The new cryptocurrency exchange that is to be launched in early 2018 and will run entirely on <strong>atomic swaps</strong>. That is, itâ€™s going to be that kind of place that should make Shapeshift obsolete: the swap is done via a trustless contract, the fees are going to be lower, the trust in the middleman not necessary.</p>

<p>The mission of altcoin.io goes even further though - they are aiming to build a decentralized trading exchange that will provide <a href="https://blog.altcoin.io/decentralized-exchanges-explained-and-why-we-need-them-more-than-ever-4ef9fbb9192d">better experience than exchanges like EtherDelta</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DEXs have been around for some time. [â€¦] While theyâ€™ve generally offered better security, theyâ€™re far from perfect. Most DEXs store your private keys on Ethereum smart contracts (using the ERC20 standard), relying on off-chain order books to fulfill your trades. This restricts the number of tradeable tokens, and slows everything down.</p>

<h4 id="what-has-been-done-so-far">What has been done so far</h4>

<p>There is a <a href="http://www.preview.altcoin.io">preview of the UI</a> but the exchange itself is not open yet. What is new is that you can already <a href="http://www.altcoin.io?kid=KHPDT">open an account to get access to the atomic swap wallet</a> (on testnet for now). Youâ€™ll be able to use the same user account once the exchange opens.</p>

<p>The account setup is similar to bitcoin wallets - <strong>you are getting your 12-word seed</strong>. That means, your account is not tied to your real-life identity and you retain the full control of the funds you are trading with.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™re in you will get access to wallets for a multitude of bitcoin-based and ethereum-based assets. You can already try out the atomic swap exchange process on the testnets, for instance with the help of a <a href="https://testnet.manu.backend.hamburg/faucet">BTC testnet faucet</a> and an <a href="https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet">ETH testnet faucet</a> where you get coins via <a href="https://twitter.com/_karlvonbahnhof/status/949975902997409792">a tweet</a> because of network spam protection.</p>

<p>Video walkthrough <a href="https://vimeo.com/249200127">here has about 6 minutes</a>, the gist is with two separate wallets in different browsers and once you have the testnet coins you can initiate a p2p atomic swap from one of the wallets. Because itâ€™s p2p, it will generate a confirmation link for the party on the other side of the trade that youâ€™ve just opened. Open it in the second wallet browser and okay it, it will complete the swap.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t really know what this all means thereâ€™s an <a href="https://blog.altcoin.io/the-evolution-of-atomic-swaps-e33ad3af8818">article about atomic swaps on blog.altcoin.io</a>. That blog also the place to follow if you want to get the latest updates on the exchange development.</p>

<p>If this is the first time you hear about the project and youâ€™d like to see what the app looks like first or get convinced this isnâ€™t a crazy scam, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94CdO6dmav0">BTCKYLE talking to the founders of altcoin.io on Youtube</a>.</p>

<p>The walkthrough for the altcoin.io wallet and atomic swaps <a href="https://vimeo.com/249200127">available from Vimeo</a> is shorter and less chatty.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>So far the testnet functions of altcoin.io are impressive but really at the Shapeshift level: you can exchange one token for another, from the user point of view itâ€™s the same experience as on Shapeshift or in a decentralized way on Bisq.</p>

<p>If atomic swap trading is going to be a thing, what is really needed is an advanced interface for traders because active trading is the game that will bring in the people and the liquidity. Luckily <a href="https://blog.altcoin.io/altcoin-exchanges-purpose-mission-values-and-value-proposition-7d525303c005">the team seems to be aware of that</a>, the preview exchange UI looks much like prettier sister of BitMEX.</p>

<p>From the blog posts itâ€™s not even clear how far from launch the development really is, though, and it is <a href="https://feedback.altcoinexchange.com/">safe to assume thereâ€™s a lot to do</a>. It is well worth staying tuned, though. Letâ€™s hope OP deliversâ€¦</p>
