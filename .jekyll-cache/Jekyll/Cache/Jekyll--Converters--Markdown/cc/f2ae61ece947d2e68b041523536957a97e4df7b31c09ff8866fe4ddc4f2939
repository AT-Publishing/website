I"ª<p>Here are the <strong>anticipated crypto deals</strong> for BlackFriday 2020.</p>

<p>In the rest of this bloody long post on AltcoinTrading.NET you can also learn of what kind of offers we got last year during <strong>Black Friday 2018/2019</strong> and the previous years. Successful campaigns are most likely to repeat (or rhyme) in November 2020.</p>

<p>Every year, Ledger wallet Black Friday deals come in a sequence.</p>

<p>Whereas during the year, crypto hodlers can get a good deal with bundles, on Black Friday Ledger typically does site-wide discounts.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/bpbf-2019">Get the current Bundle discount offer</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In 2019 the first wave of pre-BlackFriday sale came with 30% off site-wide at Ledger. It was not as low as it could get, but there was enough stock and the discount applied even on Ledger Nano X which was still a new product.</p>

<h5 id="ledger-nano-x-black-friday-2020-anticipated-30-off">Ledger Nano X Black Friday 2020: Anticipated 30% Off</h5>

<p><span class="star-rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…</span></p>

<p>The Ledger Nano X is a BluetoothÂ® enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.</p>

<p>Nano X is still the top product that Ledger has, so we do not expect much hotter deals than 30% off.</p>

<h4 id="ledger-nano-s-black-friday-2020-anticipated-70-off">Ledger Nano S Black Friday 2020: Anticipated 70% Off</h4>

<p><span class="star-rating">â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…</span></p>

<p>Ledger Wallet did the Black Friday 2017 offer of 21% off on your Ledger Ledger Nano S, but in Black Friday 2018, the disount on Nano S went up to 50% discount.</p>

<p>In 2019, Nano S buyers could get it with as much as 60% off, albeit for a short time in a bundle deal.</p>

<p>The pattern is clear however that as the product gets older, the discount in sales events grows. We are anticipating the 2020 Black Friday deal on Ledger Nano S to be around 70% off.</p>
