I"Z<p>Anonymous coins have always been a concern for the App Store as allegedly they didn’t want to be linked to illicit activities. If you are a DASH holder though, your situation regarding wallets is a bit less bleak than what’s normal for crypto right now.</p>

<p><strong>The new official DASH wallet</strong></p>

<p>The DASH wallet app was released just yesterday to the Apple App Store. It is a cryptocurrency wallet specifically for DASH and <a href="https://bankinnovation.net/2017/07/after-long-wait-apple-oks-dash-wallet-for-ios-app-store/">was created by the DASH Foundation, so there is no reason to worry about scams and counterfeit apps</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-wallet/id1206647026?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Link to the DASH wallet</a></p>

<p><strong>Z-Cash was approved for the App Store too, but is only available via Jaxx</strong></p>

<p>Zcash was the first anonymous cryptocurrency to get Apple’s blessings. There was a <a href="https://forum.z.cash/t/zcash-and-jaxx-announce-zec-approved-and-live-on-ios-appstore/15227">press release campaign in April 2017</a> announcing Apple approved ZEC for App Store, and Jaxx integrated it. Right now the Jaxx wallet for iOS from April 2017 supports both DASH and ZEC, <strong>even though the description of the app on iTunes doesn’t say so</strong>.</p>

<p>Jaxx was planning to integrate ZCASH <a href="https://twitter.com/jaxx_io/status/785833459772162048">unce upon a time even along with Monero</a> - but that doesn’t look very likely anymore. </p>

<p>Either way, the problem with <a href="https://www.altcointrading.net/jaxx-vulnerability">Jaxx is the security vulnerability of Jaxx desktop</a> version. Recently there was also a problem with the servers on which the backend is running, and people were <a href="https://twitter.com/jaxx_io/status/883849413294256128">unable to access their ETC funds for the whole weekend</a>. There was no warning in the app, it just showed old data apparetly from a backup, and the app was frozen - not a nice way to persuade people to store their monies in it. </p>

<p>So, although the iOS app is not suffering from the vulnerability of the desktop wallet, it is currently <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jaxx-blockchain-wallet/id1084514516?mt=8">collecting negative reviews on the App Store</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Monero people, don’t get ahead of yourselves</strong></p>

<p>Monero’s situation is even better! There is a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monero-wallet-by-freewallet/id1126426159?mt=8">Monero wallet approved by the App Store</a> right now but as slick as it looks, it is a scam. It has been a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/5lrnw8/anyone_use_the_monero_app_on_the_apple_app_store/">known scam for at least six months</a> yet it is still available on the wonderful Apple App Store with diligent app reviews.</p>
