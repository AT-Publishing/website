I"ý<p>Welcome to the <strong>crypto tradersâ€™ glossary</strong> on <strong>ATNET</strong> (AltcoinTrading.NET).</p>

<p>This is the place where you will find all the crypto trading jargon you ever wanted to understand but was afraid to ask.</p>

<p>A lot of crypto jargon are actually nicknames for common indicators from technical analysis. Those glossary entries have a super short explanation of the concept and then links to more thorough content here on ATNET.</p>

<p>Most of the jargon is just funny, though. <a href="/glossary/squishy/">The Squishy</a>, <a href="/glossary/bart/">the Bart and Trab</a>, <a href="/glossary/bgd/">the BGD</a> - we have it all.</p>

<p>We are throwing into the mix some 101 on technical analysis and basic market principles.</p>
