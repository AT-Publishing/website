I"È<p>The Ledger Nano X Pre-BlackFriday Special 2019 was a nice one.</p>

<p>Before the start of the Black Friday 2019 week, Ledger was offering a special edition of <strong>Nano X</strong> wallets with a ‚ÄúTo the moon‚Äù engraving.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong>: The engraving is not just for vanity. It‚Äôs good to tell your devices apart, if you have multiple.</p>

<p>Ledger then proceeded with the Black Friday offers for 2019 starting on November 25, 2019.</p>

<p>Early in the Black Friday week same the early offers. These were leading up to the actual Black Friday deals on November 29, 2019 and ending the week with Cyber Monday on December 2, 2019.</p>

<p>The deals varied between 20-30% discount on Ledger wallets or bundles.</p>
