<h5 id="why-its-good-to-have-more-than-one-hardware-wallet">Why itâ€™s good to have more than one hardware wallet</h5>

<p>The best way to make use of the Ledger discount code deal is to have as big a total bill as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can buy Ledger Nano X to use as your cold-ish storage. The Ledger Nano X is a BluetoothÂ® enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.</li>
  <li>Ledger Nano S is cheaper but can pretty much operate with a single crypto on it only, due to the small memory. That makes it ideal for a single-purpose wallet.</li>
  <li>So, if you trade mostly with, say, Bitcoin as your base currency, Ledger Nano S is the most time-, cost- and security-efficient wallet to serve as your trading wallet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s also useful to have a separate wallet for the darknetmarkets. Speaking purely hypothetically of course.</p>
