I"Z<p>The Bart Formation, or just Bart, is a colloquial name given by crypto traders to a chart pattern that is also sometimes called “pump and dump”. The cryptocurrency rallies sharply, usually on a shorter timeframe like 30M, and after a pretty much flat period retraces all of its previous gain. The name Bart came from the pattern’s likeness to the shape of Bart Simpson’s head.</p>

<p>On bitcoin markets, the Bart occurs mostly after a long periods of sideways when the traded volumes decline and nothing is happening. On altcoin markets, where thinner books are normal, you can still see Barts quite often.</p>

<p>The idea behind the Bart pattern is that there was an attempt to start a markup in the market, by a single actor or by means of organic uncoordinated speculation, but that attempt did not catch on. It is therefore a signal of market weakness.</p>
