I"O<p>In the crypto trader jargon, BGD is short for “big green dildo”. BGD is a large green candle painted at some substantial timeframe (4H, 1D).</p>

<p>Calling a BGD on a short timeframe chart (5M, 30M) will typically result in prompts to “zoom out”, which is to consider the bigger picture by switching to a longer timeframe chart before reacting sensationally.</p>

<p>The opposite of BGD is a “Big Red Dildo”, BRD, a big red candle on a longer timeframe chart.</p>

<p>Some cryptocurrency traders may also call a BGD the “Jesus candle” and BRD the “Judas candle”.</p>
