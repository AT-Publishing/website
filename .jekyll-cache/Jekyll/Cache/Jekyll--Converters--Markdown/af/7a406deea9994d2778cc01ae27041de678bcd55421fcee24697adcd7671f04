I"†<p>TradingView subscriptions can now be paid via PayPal, credit cards, debit cards <em>or via cryptocurrency</em>. When the crypto payments were launched, there was an offer called ‚ÄúTradingview To The Moon‚Äù.</p>

<p>It set the subscription price as denominated in BTC, and because BTC was trending sideways or down then, you could get as much as 50% off as the fiat value of BTC dropped.</p>

<p>This was a rare opportunity to get some money off on TradingView though. You‚Äôre pretty much stuck with Black Friday.</p>

<p><em>Start with <a href="http://bit.ly/at-tvd-eth" rel="nofollow">TradingView FREE plan</a> and if you like it, upgrade on Black Friday.</em></p>
