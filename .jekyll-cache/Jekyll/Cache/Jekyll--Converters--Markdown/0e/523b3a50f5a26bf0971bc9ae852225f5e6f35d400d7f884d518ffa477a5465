I")<p>The online payment app <a href="https://coinvendit.com">Vendit</a> has now added Uber among their supported partners.</p>

<p>Vendit is a blockchain-based fintech app that is working in a host of very diverse areas of interest.</p>

<p>They are building a payment system APIs to effectively connect trading on existing exchanges for their clients, they run their own hybrid DEX/CEX, they are dabbing into blockchain-based loans and they have developed a payment system for merchants.</p>

<p>While Vendit focuses strongly on B2B payments (and commissions), the payment system is also accessible in a user-friendly form from Vendit app, which makes it easy to spend your cryptocurrency on your every day expenses - at least as long as they come with a hipster smartphone app. Uber now freshly joins the ranks of GameStop, Domino’s or IHOP.</p>

<p>Vendit is putting reasonable amount of hope into the new payment link to Uber as it is pretty much a household name among the new gig economy apps and at the same time one that is still very commonly used.</p>

<p>The popularity of Uber could bring Vendit a good amount of new users who will be curious how funding a ride via cryptocurrency token works at all.</p>

<p>Future-wise, it could be wise to keep up with Vendit’s development as they have already implemented a cashback service for shopping at selected fashion retail stores. If the app gains a steady user base, the cashback options will probably grow.</p>

<p><em>As of late 2018, a substantial amount of equity in Vendit Payment Systems is owned by <a href="https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/intelligence/libereum-crypto-investment-acquired-spanish-elche-cf/">Libereum, a European digital currency firm</a> that has been acquiring football clubs across the world and developing use cases for cryptocurrency payments within sports merchandise and football management backoffice.</em></p>
