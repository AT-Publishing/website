I"o<p>This is a list of security tools that are helpful in avoiding cryptocurrency scams, impostors and phishing.</p>

<p>We will be updating the list regularly, and you are all invited to submit your favorite tools in the comment section.</p>

<p>Just bear in mind the tools presented here are <strong>far from a guarantee</strong>: They are mostly browser extensions, if they change owner (and consequently codebase) you won’t know it. They are also mostly reactive - they rely on a database of known malicious domains or IPs - but you can always have the bad luck of being the first one to encounter a scam.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.altcointrading.net/sec/tools/netcraft.png" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - List of tools for scam detection"><figure class="border"><amp-img itemprop="image" src="https://www.altcointrading.net/sec/tools/netcraft.png" alt="List of tools for scam detection" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - List of tools for scam detection" layout="responsive" width="700px" height="360px"></amp-img></figure></a></p>

<p>The company behind <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netcraft-extension/bmejphbfclcpmpohkggcjeibfilpamia?hl=en">Netcraft extension</a> provides a bunch of anti-malware services, phishing detection and fraud alerts. They even have an intelligent system that calculates a score of how likely is it that a domain name is a fraudulent imposter.</p>

<p>You can get all this as a Chrome and Firefox extension <a href="https://www.netcraft.com/anti-phishing/">here</a>. It will either show all the info about the domain your currently visiting in the toolbar, or it will make it available on click.</p>

<h3 id="wot-web-of-trust">WOT (Web Of Trust)</h3>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wot-web-of-trust-website/bhmmomiinigofkjcapegjjndpbikblnp?hl=en">WOT</a> is an extension that fetches user-submitted reputation from the WOT website.</p>

<h3 id="metamask">Metamask</h3>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en">Metamask</a> is an Ethereum wallet in a Chrome extension. It is not super safe as a wallet, but if you keep the extension activated it will block your access to websites that are listed as DNS-hijacked or malicious.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/SackX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SackX</a>, Metamask blocks access to <a href="https://t.co/qqWckLB12V">https://t.co/qqWckLB12V</a>, says it is malicious or infected. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#crypto</a> <a href="https://t.co/PpciODpoEe">pic.twitter.com/PpciODpoEe</a></p>&mdash; ThankYouForFOMO (@TradingFanbois) <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingFanbois/status/1082888794947215361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">9 January 2019</a></blockquote>

<h3 id="sessionbuddy">SessionBuddy</h3>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.altcointrading.net/sec/tools/sessionbuddy.png" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - List of tools for scam detection"><figure class="border"><amp-img itemprop="image" src="https://www.altcointrading.net/sec/tools/sessionbuddy.png" alt="List of tools for scam detection" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - List of tools for scam detection" layout="responsive" width="700px" height="360px"></amp-img></figure></a></p>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko?hl=en">SessionBuddy</a> is meant as a convenience tool rather than a security tool, but it could be helpful to those of you who are either new to crypto or don’t really check their holdings and exchange accounts very often.</p>

<p>It is a known issue that Google Ads will show blockchain.com imposters that will wipe out the real blockchain.com wallet accounts of those who fall for it.</p>

<p>SessionBuddy is a browser extension that lets you save your current set of tabs, edit it and name it. That means you only need to make sure once you are on the real site; next times you just open the URLs from your SessionBuddy folder. This protects you from deceptive imposter domains.</p>

<h3 id="minerblock">MinerBlock</h3>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minerblock/emikbbbebcdfohonlaifafnoanocnebl?hl=en">MinerBlock</a> is an extension mainly for convenience: it will block JavaScript miners all over the web without disabling other JavaScript functionalities.</p>

<p>While cryptocurrency browser miners are not dangerous, and these days they should require consent anyway, they will deplete your laptop’s battery. Why not kill them then.</p>

<h3 id="ghostery">Ghostery</h3>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery-%E2%80%93-privacy-ad-blo/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij?hl=en">Ghostery</a> is a popular ad blocker and tracking deactivator. It’s mostly for your privacy, but it is known that ads sometimes carry malware too.</p>

<p>The downside is lot of websites will detect the ad blocker and require you to turn it off otherwise you won’t get to see the content.</p>
