<p>Now that crypto hardware wallets and charting apps have been around for a few years, this is not our first rodeo. It is known what traders can expect for Black Friday deals from Tradingview or Ledger wallet, and whether there are any offers that will get you Black Friday value before Black Friday 2019.</p>

<h4 id="tradingview-pay-in-bitcoin">TradingView Pay in Bitcoin</h4>

<p><span class="star-rating">‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</span></p>

<p>TradingView has opened an offer for crypto traders to promote their new payment option - Bitcoin. Previously, you were only able to pay your TradingView PRO with Paypal but since February 2019, a BTC payment option is added.</p>

<p>The price for the Tradingview subscription with crypto payments is fixed in Bitcoin, and so its USD value varies with the BTCUSD ratio.</p>

<p><b>Go to the crypto offer homepage of this <a href="http://bit.ly/tradingview-moon" rel="nofollow">TradingView Deal</a> and see how much discount you‚Äôll be getting.</b></p>

<h4 id="ledger-nano-x-to-the-moon-discount">Ledger Nano X ‚ÄúTo the Moon‚Äù Discount</h4>

<p>Ledger is selling their wallets with a special ‚ÄúTo the moon‚Äù branding to celebrate their anniversary.</p>

<p>Ledger Nano X is a new product, and as you know, newly launched tech toys normally do not get on sale.</p>

<p>If you want to save on the new Ledger Nano X wallet but don‚Äôt care for the Backup Pack above, your only option is to get the <a href="https://hodlerscashback.com/hi/#shop">3% Ledger Nano X Cashback</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not much, but it sure is better than nothing.</p>

<p>If you already have a Ledger Nano X but want another one because you hold more altcoins that fits into the wallet‚Äôs memory, get the new <a href="http://bit.ly/2oa15vh">‚ÄúTo the Moon‚Äù edition of Ledger Nano X</a> - this way you will be able to tell the wallets apart.</p>

<p>If you access Ledger wallet‚Äôs shop through <a href="https://hodlerscashback.com/hi/#shop">Hodler‚Äôs Cashback</a>, you‚Äôll still get cashback on your bill even with the new ‚ÄúTo the Moon‚Äù edition of Ledger Nano X.</p>

<h4 id="ledger-nano-s-black-friday-sale-up-to-50-off-hardware-wallets">Ledger Nano S Black Friday Sale: up to 50% OFF hardware wallets</h4>

<p><span class="star-rating">‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</span></p>

<p>In 2018, Ledger Wallet opened with the first crypto-related <strong>early bird deal</strong>, 20% off on <em>Ledger Nano S</em> ordered between October 17 - October 22.</p>

<p>This campaign was followed on October 31 with a <strong>limited edition Ledger Wallet</strong>, themed for the 10 year anniversary of the Satoshi white-paper.</p>

<p>Through November 2018, Ledger was running a pre-BlackFriday promo for bulk orders on their <strong>special color edition</strong>.</p>

<p>The point of making the most popular cryptocurrency wallet available in 6 different colors was to <strong>make it easier to admin</strong>. With Nano S you can hardly ever use enough wallet apps in a single device, so it has value to be actually able to <strong>tell your hardware wallets apart</strong>.</p>

<p>The bulk offer was quite standard for Ledger:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>20% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 1 Color Edition
30% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 2 or more Color Edition
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The early bird offers were finished off with a flat 50% discount on Ledger Nano S.</p>

<p><span class="star-rating">‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</span></p>

<p>Ledger Wallet used to do the Black Friday offer of <strong>21% off on your Ledger Ledger Nano S</strong> but in Black Friday 2018, they released several early-bird offers finishing with a 50% discount.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether that was a one-off event due to the crypto bear market or due to their launch of <a href="http://bit.ly/ledger-nano-x">Ledger Nano X</a> device in early 2019.</p>

<p>It is expected that due to the increasing competition and also the wider product range at Ledger <strong>the higher discount will repeat for Black Friday 2019</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="tradingview-pro-black-friday-deal">TradingView Pro Black Friday Deal</h3>

<p>TradingView has yearly Black Friday offer for a limited time where they go down with the subscription price considerably. Depending on your PRO plan, you end up with up to 50% discount.</p>

<h4 id="why-go-pro-on-tradingview">Why go PRO on TradingView</h4>

<p>You can keep using TradingView FREE forever but you can only save a one single chart. That means you can only watch one market at a time, nothing like BTCUSD nect to ETHUSD. Additionally, you have no access to intraday spread (looking into arbitrage opportunities between different fiat denominations on shorter timeframes than 1D) and the number of indicators or scripts per chart is limited to 3. That is perhaps bbands, ichimoku cloud and MACD and you cannot even volume color your candles.</p>

<p>With the PRO+ plan you can save 4 layouts and access them from 2 devices, you get 30 server side alerts for either price targets or indicator value targets. You have the allowance of 10 strategies or indicators per chart.</p>

<p>TradingView is the most popular charting and alert tool for cryptocurrency traders to this day. It is reliable, it doesn‚Äôt take up as much memory as cryptowatch and if you are willing to block 100+ people in the chat, you will find the community stunning. (Just kidding. It‚Äôs a great charting platform though.)</p>

<h3 id="coinigy-black-friday-deal">Coinigy Black Friday Deal</h3>

<p>Coinigy is great for true altcoin traders who want to be the market makers in new markets, who want to leverage arb opportunities and need to stay up to date about opening markets. It is not only a charting engine but also an API interface you can use to access your exchange account without using the crypto exchange web interface, which is usually terrible with the exception of <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC">Bitfinex</a> and <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/register/iYQB44">BitMEX</a>.</p>

<p>Coinigy doesn‚Äôt charge any additional fee for executing trades via the platform.</p>

<p>The subscription plans prices differ based on the length of your subscription but on Black Friday, you can get a lifetime plan for as little as 3 USD a month. That‚Äôs pretty much for free, and you get great charting engine, the possibility to trade on multiple exchanges from a single interface and notifications about new markets going live.</p>
