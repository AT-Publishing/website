I"ê<p>The crypto exchange CEX.IO is following suit and doing what <a class="intern" href="/bitfinex-referrals-stopped">Bitfinex is attempting to do</a>: temporarily staying away from taking new users in as their exchange engine and support staff is overloaded.</p>

<p>They cite their long term strategy of providing the best possible service to their customers as the reason - they are not keeping up with the explosive growth in crypto space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As 2017 has shown explosive growth of interest to cryptocurrencies [â€¦] Our user base grew 200% this year.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The inflow of registrations, however, has put additional pressures on our support and verification teams. To maintain security [â€¦] we choose to stick to our strict AML and KYC policies, even if it comes at the expense of on-boarding speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our KYC and AML procedures impose a certain amount of time required for each registration to process [â€¦] we choose to temporary pause new registrations and allocate extra efforts and resources to processing the current queue.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will be providing frequent status updates via <a href="https://twitter.com/cex_io">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CEX.IO/">Facebook</a>.</p>
