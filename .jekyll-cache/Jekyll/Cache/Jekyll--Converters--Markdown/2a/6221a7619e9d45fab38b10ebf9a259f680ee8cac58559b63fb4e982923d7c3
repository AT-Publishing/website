I"<p>In the crypto trader jargon, <strong>perps</strong> is short for <strong>perpetual contract</strong> or <strong>perpetual swap</strong>, a popular derivative product intruduced by <a href="http://bit.ly/2Muo11z">BitMEX trading platform</a>. Similar product is now traded also on OKEx and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The perpetual contract is derivative product like a future contract, but there is no expiration date. Therefore you will not get the futures-specific behavior near the expiration date, the perpetual contract behaves more like spot market.</p>

<p>The most obvious difference for you as a crypto trader is that to long a BTCUSD perpetual contract, you deposit crypto, whereas on spot market you would need USD to long a BTCUSD market.</p>

<p>If you are speculating short term and interested in getting your profit in crypto, perps will do a better job than margin trading the fiat pair as they pay out directly in crypto.</p>

<p>If you want to long in the sense of <a href="/glossary/lth/">buy and hold</a>, do it on the spot market for fiat money.</p>
