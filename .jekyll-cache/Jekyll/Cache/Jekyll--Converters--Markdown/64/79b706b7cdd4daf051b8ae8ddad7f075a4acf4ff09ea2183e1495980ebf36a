<h4 id="about-altcointradingnet">About AltcoinTrading.NET</h4>

<p>We are a group of traders and we write for traders. We are not a fast-news website, the aim of AltcoinTrading.NET is to</p>

<ol>
  <li>publish product and news analyses on subjects that move the crypto world</li>
  <li>to serve people interested in building a skill</li>
</ol>

<p>For the sake of clarity, we only serve the information on which our readers should form their decision themselves, non of the content we publish constitutes an investment advice or a security advice. <a href="/disclaimer/">Read our disclaimer</a></p>

<h4 id="content-disclosure">Content disclosure</h4>

<p>AltcoinTrading.NET does <strong>not</strong> publish trading advice, tips, calls or any other directional recommendations regarding cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency markets or any other markets. We occasionally publish <a href="/fibs/daily">market news commentary</a> which is meant to remain neutral and is only published for educational purposes, to showcase how information can be extracted from charting patterns.</p>

<p>We sometimes (not always) get compensated to distribute press releases and information about information airdrops.</p>

<p>All sponsored content is separated from regular articles on the site: <a href="/airdrops/">Airdrops are limited to the single page /airdrops/</a>, <a href="/press/">Press Releases are always prominently tagged PRESS RELEASE and all listed at /press/</a>. Press releases are not distributed to our readers via email marketing.</p>

<p>Articles published in the main content sections (prominently tagged as BLOG, FEATURE, USER GUIDE, SECURITY, STRATEGY) <strong>are never sponsored in any way</strong>, even if they feature a commercial product.</p>

<p>For any content that features a tradeable cryptocurrency we require the author to not have an open position in said cryptocurrency nor to open one within 48 hours after publishing.</p>

<h4 id="links-disclosure">Links disclosure</h4>

<p>In the sidebar, in the Airdrops section, in advertisement banners and very occasionally in text, we sometimes use affiliate links. We do not use affiliate links to products belonging to companies that we work for on a professional basis. We don’t use shorteners to mask referral links.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to avoid affiliate links:</strong></p>

<p>All content from AltcoinTrading.NET that is marked as “News” gets deployed simultaneously at AltcoinTrading.NET and at News.AltcoinTrading.NET. <strong>Articles on News.AltcoinTrading.NET do not contain any affiliate links</strong> and banner advertising on News.AltcoinTrading.NET is limited to the homepage.</p>

<h5 id="privacy--spam">PRIVACY &amp; SPAM</h5>

<p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>

<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p>

<p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</p>

<p>= By a “Last updated” note at the top of this page.</p>

<p>How does our site handle do not track signals?</p>

<p>= We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

<p>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</p>

<p>= It’s also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking.</p>

<p>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</p>

<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>

<p>= We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

<p>Fair Information Practices</p>

<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>

<p>= We will reserve the right to change this section without notifying our users since we collect no contact information to our users.</p>

<p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

<p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>

<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

<p>= We collect email addresses to send out weekly newsletters. Every email sent by us contains an unsubscribe link in the footer.</p>
