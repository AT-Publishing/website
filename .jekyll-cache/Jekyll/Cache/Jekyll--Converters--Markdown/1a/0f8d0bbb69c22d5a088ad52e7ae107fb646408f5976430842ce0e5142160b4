I"Ã<p>In crypto jargon, <strong>SFYL</strong> is short for <strong>Sorry for your loss</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you will see the <strong>SFHL</strong> version, which stands for <strong>Sorry for his/her loss</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Within the crypto community, the SFYL phrase has been coined on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r/buttcoin</code> Reddit forum. Buttcoin is an old (and still active) forum for people who think that cryptocurrencies are a joke.</p>

<p>Originally, they would repost comments and posts about people investing in BTC and commenting with ‚ÄúSFYL‚Äù.</p>

<p>Over time this understandably lost most of its relevancy, but the phrase kept being used in other contexts within the crypto community.</p>
