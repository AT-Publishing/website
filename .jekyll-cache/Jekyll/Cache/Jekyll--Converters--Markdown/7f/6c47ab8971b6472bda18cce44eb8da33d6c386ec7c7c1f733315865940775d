<p>Volume trading strategies that spread the most include:</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Filling the gap</strong>: If the price action went fast on a very thin volume, the theory says the price will throw back to the volume support and ‚Äúfill the gap‚Äù.</li>
  <li><strong>Volume vs price change</strong>: If the price moves a lot on a thin volume, the sustainability of the action is questioned. This situation can paint the <a href="/glossary/bart/">Bart Simpson pattern</a>.</li>
