<h3 id="tensorcharts-basics-how-to-read-tensorcharts">Tensorcharts Basics: How to read TensorCharts?</h3>

<p>For the absolute basics, there are walkthrough videos made directly by the developer. They have about 1 minute each. You‚Äôll see in them an old version of TensorCharts, but it doesn‚Äôt matter since they are super basic: The principle of order flow visualization candles didn‚Äôt really change.</p>

<h4 id="order-flow--graded-candles">Order Flow / Graded Candles</h4>

<p>Order Flow candles are similar to normal OHLC candles (open, high, low, close for a given time interval). Additionally though, they are split into blocks on the vertical axis - that is, into blocks per price difference.</p>

<p>The idea is that as a scalper looking for this granular information about what is happening at the very short time frame, with an OHLC candle you would probably switch from 5M chart to 1M chart. But these ultra short time frames give a lot of false signals when it comes to support/resistance or most indicators.</p>

<p>If you know how to real an order flow candle, you don‚Äôt need to change timeframes because some of the granular data is already available from the longer timeframe chart.</p>

<h4 id="cvd--cumulative-volume-delta">CVD / Cumulative Volume Delta</h4>

<p>The cummulative volume delta is an indicator that tracks changes in traded volumes through time intervals.</p>

<p>If you learn to read the CVD, you will be able to use it to spot price reversals. That‚Äôs why the tutorial below talks about the ‚Äúpredictive game‚Äù.</p>
