I"Ë<p>We distinguish <em>regular divergence</em>, <em>hidden divergence</em> and <em>exaggerated divergence</em>.</p>

<p><em>Regular Divergence</em> is a sign of trend reversal. Price keeps the trend but indicator already shows the reversal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signal to <strong>short</strong> = regular divergence in <strong>tops</strong>. Price makes higher high but oscillator makes lower high. Underlying weakness, possible exhaustion at the end of a bull trend.</li>
  <li>Signal to <strong>long</strong> = regular divergence in <strong>bottoms</strong>. Price makes lower low but oscillator makes higher low. Underlying strength, possible bottoming in progress.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Hidden Divergence</em> is a divergence that follows the trend. Hidden divs show the market is inclined to continue the current trend.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signal to <strong>short</strong> = hidden divergence in <strong>tops</strong>. Price makes lower highs but oscillator makes higher highs. Tends to be found on lower highs in a downtrend.</li>
  <li>Signal to <strong>long</strong> = hidden divergence in <strong>bottoms</strong>. Price makes higher low but oscillator makes lower low. Tends to be found during continuation pauses in an uptrend.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Exaggerated Divergence</em> is only different in that price makes double top or double bottom rather than new high or new low.</p>

<p>Divergence itself is not a strong enough signal to trigger a trading decision about entry or exit.</p>
