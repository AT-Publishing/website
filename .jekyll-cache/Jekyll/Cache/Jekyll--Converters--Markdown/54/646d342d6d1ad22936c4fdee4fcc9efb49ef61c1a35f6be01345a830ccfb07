I"¡<p>Revolut is a banking app used as a digital wallet. You can pair with your bank account and generate virtual and plastic debit cards in a number of fiat currencies to use them for Uber, dating apps or any place which you donâ€™t trust enough to link your main credit card.</p>

<p>Revolut is known mostly in Europe, but paperless banking apps are getting popular worldwide.</p>

<p>That is the reason why it was kind of a big deal to some when Revolut announced they are adding cryptocurrencies to their apps. In September 2020, they opened additional feature - the ability to <a href="/glossary/dca/">DCA</a> into a cryptocurrency.</p>

<p><strong>Revolut has since been the easiest option to onramp to cryptoâ€¦Kinda.</strong></p>

<h4 id="revolut-is-not-a-cryptocurrency-wallet">Revolut is not a cryptocurrency wallet</h4>

<p>Revolut has full custody of the cryptocurrencies you buy there.</p>

<p>You can buy crypto at Revolut, but you cannot send it out to your own wallet. Withdrawals to <a href="/altcoin-wallets/">external crypto wallets</a> are not possible with Revolut; you can only buy crypto to sell it later - that is, as a speculative trade.</p>

<p><strong>If that doesnâ€™t put you off, below is how to set up the recurring buy (DCA) on Revolut.</strong></p>

<h4 id="set-up-recurring-buy-in-revolut-app">Set up recurring buy in Revolut app</h4>

<p><strong>1 - Go to your crypto portfolio</strong></p>

<p>If you have the most recent version of the Revolut app, the <em>Recurring Buy</em> option will be available directly from your crypto portfolio in the Revolut app.</p>

<p><strong>2 - Choose which cryptocurrency to buy</strong></p>

<p>As you see, there is a few big altcoins available next to BTC.</p>

<p><strong>3 - Decide on frequency</strong></p>

<p>If you run out of funds in Revolut itâ€™s no big deal, your DCA transaction will simply not go through.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantages-of-dca-in-revolut-app">Disadvantages of DCA in Revolut app</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You donâ€™t own your crypto, and yet you need to do full KYC</li>
  <li>The transaction fees are crazy high (2.5% for standard Revolut users and 1.5% for premium and metal users)</li>
  <li>Impossible to do proper short term trading like on an <a href="/altcoin-exchanges/">altcoin exchange</a>, but no way to send crypto out</li>
  <li>You canâ€™t DCA out, there are only recurring buys available and not sells</li>
</ul>

<p>If some of these points is a dealbreaker to you (and I hope there is at least one), you can <a href="/coupon-independent-reserve/">auto-DCA on Independent Reserve</a>. Independent reserve is a real, legitimate custodial platform that lets you do with your crypto whatever you see fit.</p>
