<h4 id="about-bitfinex">About Bitfinex</h4>

<p>Bitfinex is a custodial crypto trading platform that provides spot trading, leveraged trading and crypto futures trading.</p>

<p>As a company, Bitfinex as well as its related companies is based in British Virgin Islands under <em>iFinex</em>.</p>

<p>Bitfinex exchange was hacked in August 2016.</p>

<p>Despite the hack it managed to retain a wide user base thanks to its powerful trading interface for desktop and also its great <a href="/bitfinex-app/">Bitfinex mobile app</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitfinex offers a wide range of markets denominated in USD, EUR, JPY from the fiat choices and BTC, ETH, EOS and many more for the crypto pairs.</li>
  <li>Tether markets as well as withdrawals are available, but dollar pairs on Bitfinex trade against USD, not Tether.</li>
  <li>Margin markets are funded via a public P2P lending system. Identity verification is not needed for lending.</li>
  <li>Bitfinex opened a derivatives section of the platform in September 2019.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user interface on Bitfinex has embedded charts from <a href="https://bit.ly/3dGlz3O">TradingView PRO</a>. The charts offer wide range of indicators for technical analysis.</p>

<p>The Bitfinex exchange is available worldwide. There is limitation on margin trade for Americans - however the exchange is still operational from American IP address. New users on US IP just have to state they are not American residents.</p>

<p><strong>No identity verification is needed other than for fiat withdrawal.</strong> There might be restrictions for Bitfinex futures based on your location.</p>

<h4 id="about-deversifi-formerly-ethfinex-eosfinex">About DeversiFi (formerly ETHFinex, EOSFinex)</h4>

<p>Bitfinex has been dabbing into non-custodial trading. Their first venture there was EthFinex, a non-custodial DEX for ETH-based trading.</p>

<p>Ethfinex.com was discontinued since 12 October 2019 and all non-custodial trading moved on to DeversiFi.</p>

<p><strong>DeversiFi</strong> is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that runs on that enables trading of tokens and any other cryptocurrency (even BTC) in it’s ‘wrapped’ form.</p>

<p>The platform is owned and maintained by the same company as the Bitfinex exchange, but offers non-custodial crypto trading: <strong>On DeversiFi, you trade crypto directly from your <a href="/altcoin-wallets/">hardware or software cryptocurrency wallet</a> without any signup</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="bitfinex-verification-levels">Bitfinex Verification Levels</h4>

<p>Getting verified on Bitfinex is <strong>not necessary for most traders</strong>, but comes with advantages even if you do not want to deposit or withdraw fiat money.</p>

<h5 id="intermediate-level-verification-on-bitfinex">Intermediate Level Verification on Bitfinex</h5>

<p><em>Requires two government IDs or one ID and a Skype video call. Also requires utility bill for address proof, no older than 90 days.</em></p>

<p>Intermediate level verification gives you a more seamless crypto experience on Bitfinex. It does not entitle you to deposit and withdraw fiat, but it does entitle you to deposit and withdraw Tether.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access to airdrops and giveaways</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting verified to at least intermediate level opens up the possibility for you to participate in <strong><a href="/airdrops/">airdrops</a></strong> that Bitfinex runs to promote new token launches on the platform.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Faster cryptocurrency deposits</li>
</ul>

<p>Verified users can trade deposited cryptocurrency faster, <strong>fewer confirmations</strong> are required before their deposit is credited.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access to exchange token</li>
</ul>

<p>Bitfinex has their own exchange token (LEO) that can generate <strong>fee discount</strong> on other tokens for you.</p>

<h5 id="full-level-verification-on-bitfinex">Full Level Verification on Bitfinex</h5>

<p><em>Requires bank statement, but only your first deposit must come from that account.</em></p>

<p>Full verification on Bitfinex entitles you to all benefits of the intermediate level, plus fiat deposits and withdrawals.</p>

<p>This is the only way in which Bitfinex still has minimum deposit requirement - you can only move <strong>fiat that is worth at least 10k USD</strong>.</p>
