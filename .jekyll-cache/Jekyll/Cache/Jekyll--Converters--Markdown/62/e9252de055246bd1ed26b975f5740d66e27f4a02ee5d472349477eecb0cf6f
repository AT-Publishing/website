<p><strong>Wyckoff method for ranging markets</strong></p>

<p>A famous <strong>trading method</strong> for making sense of a sideways market. You have probably heard the terms - distribution, accumulation, reaccumulation, redistribution.</p>

<p>Wyckoff used <strong>supply and demand laws</strong> together with basic <a href="/glossary/market-psychology/">market psychology cliches</a>.</p>

<p>The resulting Wyckoff method is a way to anticipate the <strong>future bias of the market</strong>. That is, whether it will be bullish or bearish once it emerges out of its sideways action.</p>

<p><strong>Wyckoff method for asset picking (Avoidance Strategy)</strong></p>

<p>The avoidance strategy is a method of choosing which asset out of a given industry to trade and which to leave be.</p>

<p>It gives your trading strategy <strong>better chances of success</strong>. Additionally, it draws <strong>insights on the state of the whole industry</strong> (here for instance cryptocurrencies, or if you want to go niche, defi for example) from the behavior of the strongest asset and the weakest asset.</p>

<p>This approach is again based on market psychology, more specifically on the changes in speculative trading asset preferences with broader changes in the industry.</p>

<p>â€¦In plain English, speculative shitcoins get bailed on first.</p>

<p>This effect can be used to work out <a href="/strategy/timing/">market timing</a> for longer-term positions.</p>
