<p>Bollinger bands are often used on forex markets, aside from crypto markets. They work well on markets that trade in pairs, such as currencies.</p>

<p>The reason for this fit is the fact that <strong>bbands are in fact a moving average with two standard deviations on either side</strong>.</p>

<p>Which means the information bbands are giving you when the price action ventures out of them is basically: <em>‚Äúthis ratio shot up a bit more then usuall - it might shoot back some time soon, but then it also might not‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>And so, now you can hopefully stop treating John Bollinger like a demi-god.</p>

<h4 id="high-probability-chart-patterns-with-bollinger-bands">High-probability chart patterns with Bollinger bands</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Double bottom, taken relatively to the bottom bband</strong> (price is about the same distance from the bottom band at both lows, in actual value terms it can be different)</li>
  <li><strong>Higher low, taken relatively to the bottom bband</strong> (price is lower on the second low, but is closer to the middle band than on the first low)</li>
  <li><strong>BBand squeeze</strong> (the <a href="/scriptspotlight-bollinger-band-width-indicator/">bandwidth strategy</a>: the distance between the top and the bottom Bollinger band is decreasing, which means volatility is low, which means at some point the volatility might get high again - duh)</li>
  <li><strong>Three pushes to a high</strong> (a topping pattern that relies on traders to be greedy in a market that is not as strong as it has been for a while until then - this buying-up results in a triple top where the consecutive tops get droopy, volume lowers and price wanders longer distance from the top Bollinger band)</li>
</ul>
