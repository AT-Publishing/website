I"y	<p>Crypto traders use <strong>div</strong> as a short for <strong>divergence</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Divergences</strong> are a “level” indicator, they are too vague to justify opening of a position.</p>

<p>Still, they are an important aspect of technical analysis and can give you edge because of how easily they get missed or misinterpreted.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-divergences">Types of Divergences</h3>

<p>We distinguish <em>regular divergence</em>, <em>hidden divergence</em> and <em>exaggerated divergence</em>.</p>

<p><em>Regular Divergence</em> is a sign of trend reversal. Price keeps the trend but indicator already shows the reversal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signal to <strong>short</strong> = regular divergence in <strong>tops</strong>. Price makes higher high but oscillator makes lower high. Underlying weakness, possible exhaustion at the end of a bull trend.</li>
  <li>Signal to <strong>long</strong> = regular divergence in <strong>bottoms</strong>. Price makes lower low but oscillator makes higher low. Underlying strength, possible bottoming in progress.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Hidden Divergence</em> is a divergence that follows the trend. Hidden divs show the market is inclined to continue the current trend.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signal to <strong>short</strong> = hidden divergence in <strong>tops</strong>. Price makes lower highs but oscillator makes higher highs. Tends to be found on lower highs in a downtrend.</li>
  <li>Signal to <strong>long</strong> = hidden divergence in <strong>bottoms</strong>. Price makes higher low but oscillator makes lower low. Tends to be found during continuation pauses in an uptrend.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Exaggerated Divergence</em> is only different in that price makes double top or double bottom rather than new high or new low.</p>

<p>Once again: Divergence itself is not a strong enough signal to trigger a trading decision about entry or exit. <a href="/divergences/">More on trading divergences here</a></p>
