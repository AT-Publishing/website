<p>The legendary investor <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-big-short-s-michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos-1.1310874">Michael Burry criticised the mass popularisation of passive investing</a> and higlighted its dangers.</p>

<p>According to Burry, index funds are distorting the market because they provide inflow of investor money to companies that would not be invested in by anyone who does his own market analysis and picks individual stocks.</p>

<p>These ‚Äúnot-so-hot‚Äù companies form the bottom part of most popular index funds - slightly over half of the businesses in Fortune 500 belongs among them, according to Burry.</p>
