<p>Couple new things at Bitfinex â€“</p>

<ul>
  <li>Individual users can now access USD wires for deposits and withdrawals</li>
  <li>Euro wires added for both corporate and individual accounts</li>
  <li>First Euro trading pair, <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/t/BTC:EUR/?refcode=5egV78YtlC">/t/BTC:EUR</a>, now live.</li>
</ul>

<p>To the delays in crypto withdrawals, bfx_drew said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Withdrawals should be speeding up now. First, there was a delay in refilling hot wallet due to travel on behalf of a couple of the signers, then it is taking a while to work through the queue, requiring frequent refilling of hot wallet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://image.prntscr.com/image/M3xDGd1kRbuN2Nue214ULg.png">this screenshot taken from 4chan</a>, Bitfinex is using a Polish bank for their EUR wires. The bank is called Bank SpÃ³Å‚dzielczy w Skierniewicach (BS Skierniewice) <a href="https://www.bsskierniewice.pl/">https://www.bsskierniewice.pl/</a> and it is not a well known, big institute. It has triggered a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7entmf/upvote_gtfo_of_bitfinex_and_maybe_bitcoin_in/">wave of mistrust on the Cryptocurrency subreddit</a>.</p>

<p><em>This post will be further amended once there is more information available.</em></p>

<p><strong>Update December 17, 2017</strong>, all money movements are problematic at the moment as Bitfinex has been under an on-and-off DDoS attack for about a week now. This is just a technical problem not related to any kind of banking issues. New user registrations are temporarily disabled too.</p>
