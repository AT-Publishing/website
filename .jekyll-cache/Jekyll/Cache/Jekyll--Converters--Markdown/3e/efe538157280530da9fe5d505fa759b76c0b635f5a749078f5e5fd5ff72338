I"‰<p>Entrepreneur and influencer Gary Vaynerchuk on Ethereum:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ethereumâ€™s got huge upside [â€¦] I still know that thereâ€™s so many people that know so much more, but hereâ€™s what I would say: It canâ€™t lose over time. So I donâ€™t know how that manifests but itâ€™s binary. Itâ€™s going to work over time. Hereâ€™s what I donâ€™t know - I donâ€™t know how I think because I havenâ€™t done my homework and what governments will do about it. [Ethereum is backed by big companies] - Big companies are much smaller than governments. So I donâ€™t know that. The reason I love Ethereum is that itâ€™s so much more agnostic than a currency. [â€¦] So overall I think itâ€™s gonna work.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/Ethereum/permalink/1221683854624326/">another version on Facebook in the Ethereum group</a> that is longer, Gary goes on to hint that maybe if the crypto space continues to grow someday in the future heâ€™s going to say â€˜You know what, fuck it,â€™ and go full on crypto.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5r4p9h">screencast of the missing part</a> from the private video from Facebook:</p>

<p>Gary Vee has been asked many times about bitcoin in his Youtube ask show but every time he simply said he understands neither crypto nor the regulations hence he canâ€™t talk about that.</p>
