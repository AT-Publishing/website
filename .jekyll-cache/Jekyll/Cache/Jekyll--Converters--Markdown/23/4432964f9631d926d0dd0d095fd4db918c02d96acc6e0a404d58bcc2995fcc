I"€<p>As you probably know, most cryptocurrency debit card providers stopped by 15th October 2017 servicing customers who reside outside of the <a href="https://mychoicecorporate.com/visa-card-issuance-list/">European Territories</a>. These are basically the European Economic Area and a few additional places. People who live outside of these areas get either refunded, or their accounts simply get suspended ‚Äì that includes EU citizens who don‚Äôt permanently reside in the EU.</p>

<p>So you see the problem. We have a f**k load of cryptocurrency debit card providers with differently crafted wow much shiny landing pages but they all rely on the same card issuer. Such clever, muh diversification.</p>

<p>The good news is if you find a prepaid card provider that uses a different issuer you should be at least temporarily able to go around the regulation that has hit us on October 15th.</p>

<p>Bad news is that while the above regulation was related to <strong>VISA</strong> cards only, <strong>MasterCard</strong> introduced something similar recently. A representative from <a href="https://worldcore.eu/Prepaid-debit-card">worldcore.eu, a Czech company that provides MasterCard cryptocurrency debit cards</a>, said: <em>‚ÄúBased on recently released conditions by MasterCard, we can only issue cards for SEPA region countries and their residents.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>In the case of <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1384807.msg21772590#msg21772590">Cryptopay in particular</a>, the new issuer is <a href="http://www.psi-pay.co.uk/product/physical-payment-card">PSI Pay Ltd. from the UK which is a MasterCard issuer</a>. PSI Pay Ltd. is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (<a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/ShPo_FirmDetailsPage?id=001b000000m4IWsAAM">FCA register number 900011</a>) for the issuing of electronic money <strong>throughout Europe</strong>, however it doesn‚Äôt imply anything for non-EU residents although Cryptopay uses PSI Pay to serve precisely those customers who reside outside of Europe. <strong>‚Äì If you do a bit of research you will eventually come across this:</strong> <a href="http://www.psi-payscam.com/fullstory/">http://www.psi-payscam.com/fullstory/</a> ‚Äì PSI Pay Ltd. is apparently closely related to a company that stole their customer‚Äôs funds and whose bank accounts and domains were seized. Author of the one-page linked above claims to be owed $100,000.</p>

<p>And, before you flee to the next safe haven, you will find <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2236259.new">very recent and very heated scam accusations regarding worldcore.eu</a> too, though. Additionally ‚Äì for those who want to be looking for red flags ‚Äì both Cryptopay (partnering with PSI Pay) and Worldcore started ICOs recently.</p>

<p>So, a word of caution: <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/?ref=4nq3">Localbitcoins</a> doesn‚Äôt sound so risky after all, does it?</p>
