<p>ODX Pte. Ltd. is a subsidiary of Xurpas, Inc., the largest consumer tech company in the Philippines founded in 2001.</p>

<p>Open Data Exchange plans to leverage the already existing infrastructure of Xurpas and thereby gain an important advantage of a ready access to emerging markets around the world.</p>

<h4 id="about-the-platform">About The Platform</h4>

<p>According to research cited by ODX, the average internet user in Southeast Asia, South America, and Africa pays for internet access for less than ten days a month. “This is especially significant when you consider the fact that over 80% of the world’s Internet population live in emerging markets,” says the ODX chairman and co-founder Nix Nolledo. Mobile data is their primary means of internet access but it is prohibitively expensive.</p>

<p>ODX proposes a global, accessible blockchain-powered marketplace for data. Utilizing the blockchain technology, publishers and ISPs will be able to transact at scale through a network of trust.</p>

<p><strong>ODX Whitepaper outlining the details of the solution and the sources of the research is currently under legal review and not yet publicly available.</strong></p>

<p>An ODX <a href="https://medium.com/alto-io/alto-io-and-open-data-exchange-odx-join-forces-19f9ab4c1e16">partnership with the world’s largest network of blockchain game developers Alto.io</a> in August 2018 suggests an important focus of ODX will be blockchain gaming and entertainment, a rapidly growing market particularly in Asia.</p>
