<p>Bitfinex is a custodial crypto trading platform that provides spot trading, leveraged trading and crypto futures trading.</p>

<p>The company that owns Bitfinex also runs a noncustodial trading platform <a href="/coupon-bitfinex-5egv78ytlc/#deversifi">DeversiFi</a>.</p>

<p>The Bitfinex platform caters towards active traders. It has a full featured interface with all you need for <a href="/daytrading/">daytrading</a> spot or futures market in crypto, and the same data-rich UI for the lending market.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bitfinex doesnâ€™t provide as high leverage as <a href="/coupon-bitmex-iyqb44/">BitMEX</a> and is <em>not</em> focused primarily on derivatives, which means the crowd on Bitfinex is less focused on very short-term speculation. Margin cascades are rare.</p>

<p>The user interface on Bitfinex has embedded charts from <a href="https://bit.ly/at-tvd-btcusd">TradingView PRO</a>.</p>
