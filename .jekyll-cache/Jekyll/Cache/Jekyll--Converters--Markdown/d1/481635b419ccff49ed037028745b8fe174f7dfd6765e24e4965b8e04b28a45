<p>Now that crypto hardware wallets and charting apps have been around for a few years, this is not our first rodeo.</p>

<p>It is known what traders can anticipate for Black Friday deals from TradingView or Ledger wallet, and whether there are any offers that will get you Black Friday value before Black Friday 2019.</p>

<p>In 2019, just as every year, the most demanded crypto trading services and products come up with interesting bundle and discount offers in the weeks leading up to Black Friday 2019, just to get the attention of the crypto crowd.</p>

<h4 id="ledger-nano-x-pre-blackfriday-to-the-moon-discount">Ledger Nano X Pre-BlackFriday: “To the Moon” Discount</h4>

<p><span class="star-rating">★★★★☆</span></p>

<p><strong>Ledger confirmed that the Black Friday offers for 2019 start on November 25 with early offers leading up to the actual Black Friday November 29 and ending the week of offers on the Cyber Monday which is December 2nd.</strong></p>

<div class="text-center"> <a class="index-internal" target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/atnet-nano-s"> <amp-img itemprop="image" src="/cta/img_blog_blackfriday.jpg" alt="Black Friday Ledger Nano X wallet for crypto traders" data-original-width="1800px" data-original-height="400px" width="740px" height="165px" layout="responsive"> </amp-img></a></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Before this start of the Black Friday week, Ledger is <em>for the last few days</em> offering the <strong>Nano X</strong> wallets with a special “To the moon” engraving.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong>: The engraving is not just for vanity. It’s also good to tell your devices apart, if you have multiple. These will not be restocked, so it’s a rare chance to get one like this.</p>

<p>Ledger Nano X is a new product, and as you know, newly launched tech toys normally do not get on sale. Ledger is currently only offering a discount package called the <a href="https://hodlerscashback.com/ledger-wallet-bundle/">Backup Pack that bundles Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to save on the new Ledger Nano X wallet but don’t care for the Backup Pack, your only option is to get the <a href="https://hodlerscashback.com/ledger-wallet/">3% Ledger Nano X Cashback</a>.</p>

<p>It’s not much, but it sure is better than nothing.</p>

<p>If you already have a Ledger Nano X but want another one because you hold more altcoins that fits into the wallet’s memory, get the new <a href="http://bit.ly/2oa15vh">“To the Moon” edition of Ledger Nano X</a> - this way you will be able to tell the wallets apart.</p>

<p>If you access Ledger wallet’s shop through <a href="https://hodlerscashback.com/hi/#shop">Hodler’s Cashback</a>, you’ll still get cashback on your bill even with the new “To the Moon” edition of Ledger Nano X.</p>

<h4 id="tradingview-pro-pre-blackfriday-pay-in-bitcoin">TradingView PRO Pre-BlackFriday: Pay in Bitcoin</h4>

<p><span class="star-rating">★★★★★</span></p>

<p>TradingView has an offer for crypto traders to promote their new payment option - Bitcoin. Previously, you were only able to pay your TradingView PRO with Paypal but since February 2019, a BTC payment option is added.</p>

<p>The price for the <strong>unlimited TradingView</strong> subscription with bitcoin payments is <strong>fixed at 0.09 BTC per year</strong>, and so the USD price for your TradingView PRO varies with the changes in BTCUSD price.</p>

<p><b>Go to the TradingView crypto offer <a href="http://bit.ly/tradingview-moon" rel="nofollow">TradingView Deal</a> and see how much discount you’ll be getting.</b></p>

<h4 id="cashback-black-friday-any-ledger-wallet-product">Cashback Black Friday: Any Ledger wallet Product</h4>

<p><span class="star-rating">★★★★★</span></p>

<p>If you access Ledger wallet’s shop through <a href="https://hodlerscashback.com/hi/#shop">Hodler’s Cashback</a> after making an account, you will get cashback on your total bill, no matter which products you will buy.</p>

<p>On Hodler’s Cashback, you get cashback on both Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X, also on all bundled offers and you will even <strong>get cashback for your already discounted  Black Friday orders</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="ledger-nano-s-black-friday-sale-up-to-50-off-hardware-wallets">Ledger Nano S Black Friday Sale: up to 50% OFF hardware wallets</h4>

<p><span class="star-rating">★★★★★</span></p>

<p>In 2018, Ledger Wallet opened with the first crypto-related <strong>early bird deal</strong>, 20% off on <em>Ledger Nano S</em> ordered between October 17 - October 22.</p>

<p>This campaign was followed on October 31 with a <strong>limited edition Ledger Wallet</strong>, themed for the 10 year anniversary of the Satoshi white-paper.</p>

<p>Through November 2018, Ledger was running a pre-BlackFriday promo for bulk orders on their <strong>special color edition</strong>.</p>

<p>The point of making the most popular cryptocurrency wallet available in 6 different colors was to <strong>make it easier to admin</strong>. With Nano S you can hardly ever use enough wallet apps in a single device, so it has value to be actually able to <strong>tell your hardware wallets apart</strong>.</p>

<p>The bulk offer was quite standard for Ledger:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>20% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 1 Color Edition
30% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 2 or more Color Edition
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The early bird offers were finished off with a flat 50% discount on Ledger Nano S.</p>

<p><strong>Originally, we were anticipating a bundled offer for the Ledger Nano X, but Ledger confirmed in a message to their affiliates that there will be site-wide discounts through Black Friday week 2019.</strong></p>

<p>They didn’t share any details but if site-wide is really site-wide, you should be able to get Ledger Nano X with a good amount of money off even if you just want to get a single wallet.</p>

<p><strong>We will update this page at »» 2PM UTC TODAY «« with more details once Ledger opens their early Black Friday deals!</strong></p>

<p>The Ledger Nano X is a Bluetooth® enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Ledger Nano X is a new product. As such, Ledger is not likely to discount it a lot. When you see any markdown offer, you shouldn’t really hesitate!</p>

<p><strong>Ledger confirmed that the Black Friday offers for 2019 start on November 25 with early offers leading up to the actual Black Friday November 29 and ending the week of offers on the Cyber Monday which is December 2nd.</strong></p>

<p><span class="star-rating">★★★★★</span></p>

<p>Ledger Wallet used to do the Black Friday offer of <strong>21% off on your Ledger Ledger Nano S</strong> but in Black Friday 2018, they released several early-bird offers finishing with a 50% discount.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether that was a one-off event due to the crypto bear market or due to their launch of <a href="http://bit.ly/ledger-nano-x">Ledger Nano X</a> device in early 2019.</p>

<p>It is expected that due to the increasing competition and also the wider product range at Ledger <strong>the higher discount will repeat for Black Friday 2019</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="tradingview-or-tensorcharts">TradingView or TensorCharts?</h3>

<p>Unless you are a scalper or an advanced trader interested in super granular data, TradingView will be a better fit for you. It’s more intuitive, the learning curve is not so high and the TA tools library is great especially for swing traders and other longer-term speculators.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC" rel="nofollow">Bitfinex</a> uses TradingView charts on their exchange, so if you trade there, the consistency is another plus.</p>

<p><b>Start with <a href="http://bit.ly/atnet-tv" rel="nofollow">TradingView FREE plan</a> and if you like it, upgrade the next Black Friday.</b></p>

<h4 id="why-go-pro-on-tradingview-tradingview-pro-vs-pro">Why go PRO on TradingView: TradingView PRO vs PRO+</h4>

<p>You can keep using TradingView FREE forever but you can only save a one single chart. That means you can only watch one market at a time, nothing like BTCUSD nect to ETHUSD. Additionally, you have no access to intraday spread (looking into arbitrage opportunities between different fiat denominations on shorter timeframes than 1D) and the number of indicators or scripts per chart is limited to 3. That is perhaps bbands, ichimoku cloud and MACD and you cannot even volume color your candles.</p>

<p>With the PRO+ plan you can save 4 layouts and access them from 2 devices, you get 30 server side alerts for either price targets or indicator value targets. You have the allowance of 10 strategies or indicators per chart.</p>

<p>TradingView is the most popular charting and alert tool for cryptocurrency traders to this day. It is reliable, it doesn’t take up as much memory as cryptowatch and if you are willing to block 100+ people in the chat, you will find the community stunning. (Just kidding. It’s a great charting platform though.)</p>

<p>Coinigy is great for true altcoin traders who want to be the market makers in new markets, who want to leverage arb opportunities and need to stay up to date about opening markets.</p>

<p>It is not only a charting engine but also an API interface you can use to access your exchange account without using the crypto exchange web interface, which is usually terrible with the exception of <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC">Bitfinex</a> and <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/register/iYQB44">BitMEX</a>.</p>

<p>Coinigy doesn’t charge any additional fee for executing trades via the platform.</p>

<p>The subscription plans prices differ based on the length of your subscription but on Black Friday, you can get a lifetime plan for as little as 3 USD a month. That’s pretty much for free, and you get great charting engine, the possibility to trade on multiple exchanges from a single interface and notifications about new markets going live.</p>
