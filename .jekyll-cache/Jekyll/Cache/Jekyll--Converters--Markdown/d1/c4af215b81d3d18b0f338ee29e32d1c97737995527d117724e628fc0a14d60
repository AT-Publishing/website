<p>One of the old but still well fitting descriptions of a typical ranging market can be found in the Wyckoff method. The Wyckoff method is focused on longer term trades and the crux of the range trading is the identification of the phase in which the market is.</p>

<p>A market can be ranging because there is an accumulation or reacummulation going on, after which a bull trend follows.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a market can be ranging because there is a distribution starting, after which a bear trend follows.</p>
