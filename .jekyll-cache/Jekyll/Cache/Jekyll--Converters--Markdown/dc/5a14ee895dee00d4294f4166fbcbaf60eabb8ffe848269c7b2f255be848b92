I"i<p>In crypto trading jargon, <strong>DYEC</strong> is short for <strong>do you even chart</strong>.</p>

<p>DYEC is a variation on the famous DYEL exclamation from online fitness communities (Do You Even Lift?) which is posted <strong>when someone gives bad advice</strong> or talks down to others while making it obvious they don’t know what they’re talking about.</p>

<p>In crypto communities, DYEC is a valid response when someone posts bad <a href="/technical-analysis/">technical analysis</a>, which is something that happens a lot in very popular communities such as <a href="http://bit.ly/at-tvd-eth">TradingView</a>.</p>

<p>By calling out bad <a href="/glossary/ta/">TA</a> you either get something to brag about on the internet (more common on Reddit), or you’ll get totally hammered by super loyal fanboi ultras (more common on Twitter).</p>
