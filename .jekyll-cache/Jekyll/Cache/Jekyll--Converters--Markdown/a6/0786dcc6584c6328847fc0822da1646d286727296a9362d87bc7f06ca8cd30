<h4 id="large-transaction-monitoring">Large Transaction monitoring</h4>

<ul>

It has a database of known cryptocurrency exchange addresses and adds the info on where to and from the money went, if the information is known.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="portfolio-tracking">Portfolio tracking</h4>

<p><a target="_blank" href="/features/noico/moonitor.jpg" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - List of No-ICO Tools for Crypto Traders and Investors"><figure class="border"><amp-img itemprop="image" src="/features/noico/moonitor.jpg" alt="List of No-ICO Tools for Crypto Traders and Investors" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - List of No-ICO Tools for Crypto Traders and Investors" layout="responsive" width="700px" height="360px"></amp-img></figure></a></p>

<p>There are several options to track the value of your cryptocurrency portfolio. The most common ones track against the fiat value of crypto but there have been some talks on r/bitcoinmarkets about adding more features for crypto traders who are interested in increasing their BTC or ETH stash rather than to monitor the fiat value of their crypto.</p>

<p><strong>There are some privacy risks associated with the use of these third party apps, <a href="/security/email-reuse">especially if you need an email to sign up</a>. You should not use your standard email address to sign up for these, and also not the one you use on any exchange. <a href="/security/email-reuse">Read more in the Security section</a>.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.blockfolio.com/">Blockfolio</a> app is almost legendary at this point - the most popular smartphone app for portfolio value tracking. It is worth pointing out there was no ICO and no expensive marketing to get Blockfolio to this place. It has basic charting and newsfeed, it supports major fiat currencies and it gives you price alerts.</li>
  <li><a href="https://coinloop.io/">Coinloop</a> is a webapp that tracks cryptocurrencies against USD for now. There are some basic news and an event calendar but for traders the most valuable functionalities are the AI signals provided on Coinloop <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7zcbqb/you_can_now_get_alerts_as_soon_as_we_generate_a/">with optional alerts</a> and also the tracking of <a href="https://coinloop.io/futures">CME and CBOE Bitcoin futures</a>. <a href="/coinloop">Here a few words from the author and tips on how to use Coinloop most effectively</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://moonitor.io/">Moonitor</a> is a desktop app developed by an enthusiast who posts to Reddit as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kumakote">u/kumakote</a>. It is an electron app (the technology you know from Jaxx desktop client) and the biggest advantage of this approach is the potential user privacy. With smartphone apps or web apps your data are invariably stored on a remote server somewhere. That means the owner of the website has not only the aggregate information about what people on the market hold, buy and sell but also the portfolio value of your email address or your phone’s ID information. With desktop app the information stays on your computer unless there is some kind of script that sends this information away. I am pointing this out because I have not reviewed the code so this is always a possibility.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="network-stats">Network stats</h4>

<p>There hasn’t been a lot of apps that track the network activity of cryptocurrencies even though some traders take into account metrics such as transactions per day, fees, mempool size or transactions per block.
