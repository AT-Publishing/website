<p><a href="http://bit.ly/at-indyres">Independent Reserve</a> is an Australian crypto exchange that stayed fairly low-profile in the industry.</p>

<p>It is not a commonly mentioned crypto exchange on Reddit’s crypto subs either, and its trading interface absolutely cannot compare to places like <a href="http://bit.ly/at-bfx-banner2020">Bitfinex</a>:</p>

<p>Luckily, in this particular comparison, its banking can neither.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Independent Reserve is open to Australian as well as international users</li>
  <li>They have several bank connections that have been more or less stable since the founding of the exchange in 2013</li>
  <li>OTC desk for higher volumes is readily available upon verification</li>
  <li>Support desk is well staffed and very responsive</li>
</ul>

<p>Attesting to the staff’s competence, try the <strong>Aussie crypto market update newsletter</strong> they issue. It’s not as fussy and long as BitMEX’s letters; and if you’re busy, it is a good summary of what’s been happening on the crypto markets.</p>

<p>It is very likely that Independent Reserve will remain a stable gateway between fiat and crypto via traditional banking and SWIFT transfers, because they are something of an outlier among crypto trading platforms and are organized as a local Australian company, not as an offshore business.</p>

<h2 id="arbitrage-trading-on-independent-reserve">Arbitrage Trading on Independent Reserve</h2>

<p>The relative unpopularity (yet still an active enough market) coupled with <strong>OTC availability and good banking connections</strong> makes Independent Reserve a good place for <strong>high-volume arbitrage trading</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>International deposits are free from 5000 USD worth and over. Withdrawals to foreign bank accounts get a flat fee of 20 USD. No third-party withdrawals, you can only withdraw to an account that’s on the name with which you verified on the exchange - this is in compliance with Australian AML laws.</li>
  <li>Independent Reserve <strong>doesn’t have higher free for instant market orders</strong>. Both maker and taker trades cost the same.</li>
  <li>The full spot exchange fee is 0.5% but fee discount start already at 100k AUD 30d traded volume. <strong>10 MM AUD volume generated over 30 days gets you down to 0.05% fee per trade</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, there is an option to purchase Independent Reserve <strong>Premium</strong> accounts which are insured, have lower trading fees and get preferential attention from support.</p>

<p><strong>Insured Premium accounts start at 15k AUD yearly</strong> - <a href="http://bit.ly/2wLQhrd">learn more</a>.</p>
