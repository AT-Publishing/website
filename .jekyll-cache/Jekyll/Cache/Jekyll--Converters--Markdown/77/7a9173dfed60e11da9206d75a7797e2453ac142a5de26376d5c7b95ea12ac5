<h5 id="about-billfodl">About Billfodl</h5>

<p>Billfodl is next to Cryptosteel one of the leaders in true cold storage for crypto - producer of the super resistant metal private key storage for the paranoid.
</p>
<p>Billfodl is made 100% of the highest quality 316 stainless steel that has super high melting point (to withstand house fires), is very resistant to corrosion (even in salt water) and also completely shock-proof (to withstand explosions). Very good for your cold storage coins that never move.
</p>
<p>They also have bundle packs of multiple steel plates, in case you are ultra paranoid and want to split your main money seed in two to store it in two different locations.
</p>
<p>Other than that, <b>you can newly get a bundle of Billfodl and a hardware crypto wallet</b>. There are bundles with Ledger, Trezor and KeepKey wallets available.</p>
<p>The e-shop at PrivacyPros accepts payments in all major debit or credit cards as well as the usual set of cryptocurrencies (BTC, LTC, ETH, XMR, DOGE). You can split your payment into interest-free installments.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Billfodl wallets <em>ship from the US</em> and only show prices before tax on their e-shop. If you're outside the US you will need to pay extra duties on your order.
