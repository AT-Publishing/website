I"*<p>Could it be that Trezor people don’t want to lose their customers for Ledger?</p>

<p>In mid June 2017 the <a href="https://www.altcointrading.net/ledger-monero">CTO of Ledger wallet said on Reddit they would implement Monero, someday</a>. There is no ETA yet and probably will not be any time soon.</p>

<p>Apparently, Slush of Satoshi Labs (the company behind Trezor wallet) is probably not willing to be left behind:</p>

<p>Any time scale of this is as unclear as with the Ledger wallet though:<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/68ulcx/would_raising_money_for_the_development_of/dh2kril/"> Slush apparently doesn’t have time to work on this so he is looking for someone from the Monero community to do the code.</a> There already is an older implementation of Monero into the Trezor firmware and it needs modifications.</p>
