  <p>Want to buy crypto but don‚Äôt have a whole bunch of savings to spend at once? No need to resort to Bitcoin ATMs in 2020.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is over ten years old now, but there are still plenty new people buying their first ever crypto.</p>

<p>Some of you are very young, others want to DCA by small amount of money, still others just don‚Äôt like to wait for monthly DCA and want to <em>stack sats</em> more often.</p>

<h4 id="bitcoin-atms">Bitcoin ATMs</h4>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the easiest way, also the most expensive</code></p>

<p>Asking around on social media, you will find that surprisingly many people use <a href="/howto/use-bitcoin-atm/">Bitcoin ATMs</a> for their small crypto purchases.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with that, except the outrageous fees. Bitcoin ATMs charge anything between 5-10% transaction fee.</p>

<p>If you just want to make a tiny purchase with some cash you know you would otherwise spend on something stupid, it is better to use the ATM.</p>

<p>If you are planning to DCA, even if by a really tiny monthly amount, consider learning to use a crypto exchange or a p2p marketplace for cryptos.</p>

<p>Even if you only literally have pocket money to spend on crypto, over time the stack will add up - and so will your transaction fees.</p>

<h4 id="p2p-marketplaces">P2P Marketplaces</h4>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easy enough on a good marketplace</code></p>

<p>Peer-to-peer marketplaces for crypto do not have a good image among crypto newbies. That‚Äôs because for some reason crypto nerds like to recommend places like Bisq, which is a p2p marketplaces with convoluted user interface that is way too hard to understand.</p>

<p>For years, the go-to place for small crypto purchases was a marketplace called <a href="/glossary/lbc">LocalBitcoins</a>. It was a simple forum where you could arrange a cash transaction with someone from your city. Alternatively you could use a local bank wire or wallets like PayPal.</p>

<p>In 2020, the place is no longer trustworthy. LocalBitcoins require site-wide identity verification and there have been reports of them irretrievably freezing user funds.</p>

<p>The reason for this is all the trouble the platform has been getting from regulators. And the reason for is that even on the backend, LocalBitcoins are a in fact simple forum. You have zero privacy while on there, the website has access to all your information.</p>

<h5 id="localcryptos-have-the-most-private-and-secure-setup">LocalCryptos have the most private and secure setup</h5>

<p>A new p2p marketplace emerged with the boom of Ethereum, that eventually took over the demand from failing LocalBitcoins and served it better.</p>

<p>The p2p marketplace is called <a href="http://bit.ly/localcryptos">LocalCryptos</a>. Currently it has the most advanced setup on the backend, while it manages to keep things pretty simple on the front end.</p>

<ul>
  <li>LocalCryptos are a dApp (decentralized app) that runs an escrow service directly on blockchain.</li>
  <li>The escrow is done via a smart contract, but the smart contract is so simple that it works even on Bitcoin blockchain. (BTC and LTC blockchains do support ‚Äúscripts‚Äù, but really just very simple ones.)</li>
  <li>If you are using one of the popular <a href="/altcoin-wallets/">crypto wallets</a> like MetaMask, you can sign up directly via the wallet.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/localcryptos">LocalCryptos</a> lets you buy crypto for cash, online wallet money or bank wire, just like it used to be on LocalBitcoins. The key difference from LocalBitcoins however is that <a href="http://bit.ly/localcryptos">LocalCryptos</a> is a <strong>non-custodial</strong> marketplace.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The marketplace doesn‚Äôt have access to the private messages you exchange with vendors (where you may be sending a scan of your ID or your bank data). All this communication is encrypted between you and the vendor.</li>
  <li>You are in full control over your crypto for the whole time. At <a href="http://bit.ly/localcryptos">LocalCryptos</a>, you either sign up directly with your wallet, or you get the seed phrase of the wallet generated by the marketplace.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, you are the sole owner of the crypto directly from the moment it is released from the escrow. The escrow is a blockchain script. All your communication with your vendor is encrypted.</p>

<p>This means the marketplace, in case of <a href="http://bit.ly/localcryptos">LocalCryptos</a>, is not a party in your transaction. the marketplace doesn‚Äôt even know anything about it, apart from the cryptocurrency transaction data that is available publicly on blockchain anyway.</p>

<p>With this kind of solid setup, even if an authority requests information from the marketplace, there is no information to be shared.</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/localcryptos">LocalCryptos</a> charges a fee and its vendors charge a markup compared to crypto exchanges, but you can get crypto for the total markup as little as 1.5%.</p>

<p><strong>If you are planning to DCA regularly, consider <a href="http://bit.ly/localcryptos">LocalCryptos</a>. The common practice is to find a reliable vendor and after a few months, move with your DCA off-platform. That will save you the platform fee and get you your crypto DCA for even cheaper.</strong></p>

<p>Your last option are regular crypto exchanges.</p>

<p>There are OG hodlers who are still worried they will lose money in a Gox 2.0. <a href="/finexening/">Well, it does still happen</a>. The remedy is easy though: Get a <a href="/blackfriday/">crypto wallet</a> (and keep it updated).</p>

<p>To buy crypto on a regular exchange you will need a bank account, so this is out of the question if you are too young or just don‚Äôt have any for whatever reason.</p>

<p>The minimum order size is almost always <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10 USD / 10 EUR / 10 GBP</code>.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<ul>

  <li>At the same time non-custodial marketplaces will give you the best privacy as well as security, as they force you to use your own cryptocurrency wallet.</li>
  <li>The minimum purchase amount on custodial exchanges is 10 USD. You should not leave that money in the exchange wallet since on a custodial exchange you don‚Äôt control it.</li>
</ul>
