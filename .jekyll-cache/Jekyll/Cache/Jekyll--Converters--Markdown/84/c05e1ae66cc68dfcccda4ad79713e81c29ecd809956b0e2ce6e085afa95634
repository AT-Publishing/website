<p>When you want to try something new like skating on a longboard you don‚Äôt need to buy the gear. You can rent it with the AllSporter app, just as you don‚Äôt buy a house when you want to try living in Paris for a month.</p>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt end here: With AllSporter you can look for someone nearby who will teach you how to ride. Both functionalities are available in the AllSporter app, clear and effortless.</p>

<p>AllSporter is issuing a token (AllSporter Coin, $ALL) to set up a marketplace in the peer-to-peer mode without the middleman. The peer-to-peer payment solution on blockchain has a practical impact in this case: it makes possible to decrease the app <strong>commission from 60% to 15%</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="how-allsporter-started">How AllSporter started</h4>

<p>In the middle of snowy winter, December 2017 in Poland, focusing on the Warsaw area AllSporter was able to successfully test and launch the initial training booking application. Not bad considering the test was carried out on a group of bears during their winter sleep.</p>

<p>Since then the smartphone app has attracted both trainers [3000] and amateur sportsperson [5000] to become loyal users of the marketplace. The developers collected their feedback and implemented the most often requested changes, which resulted in a more tailored app.</p>

<h4 id="why-tokenize-allsporter">Why tokenize AllSporter?</h4>

<p>AllSporter ($ALL) tokens will be used for smoother and less costly payment processing.</p>

<p>The system is automated by a smart contract to distribute earnings for trainers and rentals. In addition, with tokenization comes a tokenized reward system for all system participants which will help with building and consolidating the AllSporter community.</p>
