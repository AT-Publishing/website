I"y<p>Dust attack is an attack on privacy that happens on the bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p>A potentially malicious actor is sends the smallest possible transaction amount to large amount of addresses and presumably runs a bot that watches from which addresses the coins were moved and where.</p>

<p>Following the movements of the dust may eventually lead to a transaction that will be identifiable in real life, such as an online order or a p2p cash sale. It can also be used to link different wallets owned by the same person.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-prevent-a-dust-attack">Can you prevent a dust attack?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Anyone can send bitcoin to any address.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-do-if-your-wallet-was-dusted">What to do if your wallet was dusted</h3>

<p>You have the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spend the dust by sending it to a miner</li>
  <li>Spend the non-dust by sending it to a new wallet</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, spending <strong>everything but the dust</strong> is a better option. More in comments under <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/ium0gd/dust_attack/">Reddit</a>.</p>
