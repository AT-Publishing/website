<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6wh1vp/daily_discussion_monday_august_28_2017/dm97mhc/">someone on Reddit noted</a>, <em>To me this makes Bitcoin’s sudden popularity in South Korea and Japan much less mysterious. I really didn’t understand it before.</em></p>

<p>It’s of course not only Bitcoin: There was a whole ETH frenzy at one point and more recently, South Korean exchange <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6vwlfl/hello_im_korean/">Bithumb listed XMR just the other day</a> which coincided with its massive bull run.</p>
