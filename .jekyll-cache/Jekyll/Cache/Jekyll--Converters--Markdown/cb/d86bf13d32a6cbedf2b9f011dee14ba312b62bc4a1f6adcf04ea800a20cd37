I"ë<p>BBands is the abbreviation for Bollinger Bands‚Ñ¢, a popular technical indicator.</p>

<p>Bollinger bands are often used on forex markets, aside from crypto markets. They work well on markets that trade in pairs, such as currencies.</p>

<p>The reason for this is the fact that bbands are basically a moving average with two standard deviations on either side. Which means the information bbands are giving you when the price action ventures out of them is basically: ‚Äúthis ratio shot up a bit more then usuall - it might shoot back now but then it also might not‚Äù.</p>

<p>And now you can hopefully stop treating John Bollinger like a demi-god.</p>
