<p>It is the last day of 2018 when I’m writing this post, so let me wish all the best to you and to crypto in the year 2019.</p>

<p>And because it’s the end of year I thought I might look at the stats of this blog for once (we’re very diligent and professional around here).</p>

<p>I found a couple of funny things to share with you and then one bit that you might actually factor into your support and resistance line-drawing art next year. That is, in the case crypto wanted to start moving up north again.</p>

<p>Here’s the fun part of the stats that tells a lot about the readers of this blog:</p>

<p><strong>1/ People are far more curious about TensorCharts than about other charting app mentioner here, but in terms of actual registrations TradingView still wins heavily.</strong></p>

<p>We’ll have to add some more guides for TensorCharts, the learning curve is obviously an issue.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/tag/tradingview-script-review/">TradingView FREE Scripts</a></li>
  <li><a href="/tensorcharts-tutorials/">TensorCharts Tutorials</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2/ For the readers of this blog, Trezor wallet is of absolutely zero interest other than occasionally checking back if they didn’t implement that Monero support after all.</strong></p>

<p>While globally, Trezor and Ledger are contenders with nearly the same traffic. Ledger has a better affiliate program so people are more vocal about it, and it’s also cheaper than Trezor.</p>

<p>I personally find Trezor more user-friendly but hey ho.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ATNET keeps the <a href="/blackfriday/">Black Friday</a> page updated all-year-round with current <a href="/blackfriday/#live">discount coupons for Ledger wallets</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3/ People go check out various exchanges but by far mostly sign up at BitMEX.</strong></p>

<p>You guys are sick gamblers.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/coupon-bitmex-iyqb44/">About BitMEX + referral code for 10% fee OFF</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4/ There is a good segment of readers who are only interested in airdrops and nothing else on this website.</strong></p>

<p>All power to you, brothers and sisters.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All <a href="/airdrops/">Upcoming Airdrops</a> are also tweeted about <em>@altcointrading_</em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="where-to-expect-the-salty-breakeven-sellers">Where to expect the salty breakeven sellers</h4>

<p>Now for the more substantial part.</p>

<p><a href="https://g.co/trends/nbt4D">Google Trends shows nicely</a> the organic search interest for Ledger Nano S, Trezor and Keepkey - each the strongest keyword for each brand by the amount of traffic it brings in. The trendlines are pretty much the same for the “buy” search phrases.</p>

<p>The price of Bitcoin hit its current ATH of just below 20k USD on <strong>December 18, 2017</strong>. The peak search interest for hardware wallets occurred between <strong>December 10, 2017 and January 6, 2018</strong>. For Ledger especially the peak was leaning to the later dates of the range, people were “buying the dip” of the top range.</p>

<p>If you pull <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history/?guccounter=1">BTCUSD price data from Yahoo Finance</a> (<a href="https://keybase.pub/altcointrading/data/BTCUSD_segment_YahooFinance.csv">relevant chunk of the CSV on Keybase</a>), daily closes for the time span give you an <strong>average buying price of around 15.5k USD per Bitcoin</strong>.</p>

<p>That is when majority of the retail bought in, or so it seems, and so there will probably be quite some salty breakeven sellers between 15-16k like there were around twelve hundred.</p>

<p>Even if a lot of the search interest didn’t lead to purchase of the wallet (or crypto), it is worth mentioning that according to SEMRush the <strong>traffic of trezor.io jumped from 4k a day to 25k visitors a day during December 2017 alone</strong>. Ledger.com gained a lot of traffic but the data is not as good because they were also slowly migrating from ledgerwallet.com to ledger.com.</p>

<p>What is perhaps more interesting is that <strong>both trezor.io and ledger.com maintained the new higher level of traffic through all of 2018</strong>, at least according to SEMRush. Since November apparently both sites appear to be breaking upwards but that can be a Black Friday thing.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, studying organic search for wallets is losing meaning just like it happened with generic bitcoin or crypto queries: People already know the products, they won’t google them anymore.</p>

<p>According to Alexa 80-90% of Trezor’s and Ledger’s traffic is referral or direct. People mostly come from places like MyEtherWallet, Youtube and blogs.</p>

<p>Doesn’t look like very dead to me, folks.</p>
