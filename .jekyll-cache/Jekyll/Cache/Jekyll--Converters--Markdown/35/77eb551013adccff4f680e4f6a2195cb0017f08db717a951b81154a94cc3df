<h2 id="deribit-kyc">Deribit KYC</h2>

<p>Deribit <strong>requires KYC</strong> for new traders since 9 November 2020.</p>

<p>The current KYC requirements are a government ID and a bill that proves your residential address.</p>

<p>The KYC at Deribit is largely automated - the documents get verified near real time. For the bill, online-only document is accepted as well (such as online banking statement)</p>

<h2 id="about-deribit">About Deribit</h2>

<p>Deribit is a crypto trading platform for cryptocurrency derivatives.</p>

<p>Their flagship product are <strong>cryptocurrency options</strong>, but Deribit also runs <a href="/glossary/perps/">crypto perps</a> markets crypto futures markets.</p>

<p>Options can be very lucrative, but if you donâ€™t know how to trade them, you can get hammered in a pretty bad way. On the other hand, using options instead of stop-loss can be a very sensible idea, especially if you trade on exchanges like Kraken that are notoriously unrealiable with order execution.</p>

<p>Deribit is building up an educational section at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insights.deribit.com</code> where they go into detail about how options work and how you can use them. For the more complex positions, you get a Google Spreadsheet to understand how your Profit/Loss would change depending on spot price.</p>

<h4 id="deribit-as-a-bitmex-alternative">Deribit as a BitMEX alternative</h4>

<p>Why is BitMEX no longer a good place to trade, to such extent that we need Deribit as an alternative?</p>

<p>Up until August 2020, BitMEX was your trusty exchange where no KYC was necessary. You could even trade there from Tor or VPN - it breached the TOS but compliance was not enforced, as was the custom.</p>

<p>In August 2020, <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/announcing-the-bitmex-user-verification-programme/">BitMEX announced they will be requiring KYC from all users starting 28 August 2020</a>. Shortly after it transpired they got into serious legal troubles, and a while later that they are possibly using their (massive!) insurance fund to make their profits unavailable to the authorities.</p>

<p>In plain English, this wonâ€™t end well.</p>

<p>The BitMEX KYC procedure includes government documents, selfie and a questionnaire. As a reminder, BitMEX does not serve US traders, but according to reports everyone who had money on BitMEX was able to withdraw.</p>

<h3 id="deribit-and-us-customers">Deribit and US Customers</h3>

<p><strong>Deribit does not serve US customers</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Deribit started requiring KYC on 9 November 2020</strong>.</p>

<p>Traders based in United States are also restricted to <a href="/coupon-bitfinex-5egv78ytlc/">trade on Bitfinex</a>, but KYC is not yet required on that platforms.</p>
