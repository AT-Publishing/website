I"É<p>While <a href="https://twitter.com/kimionis/status/954112970338029570">Coinomi is still testing out its Monero integration</a>, there is another app the name of which begs for the worst of puns: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cake-wallet-for-xmr-monero/id1334702542?mt=8">Cakewallet for iOS is out</a>. The app is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7ri9v8/our_monero_wallet_called_cakewallet_for_ios_is/">legitimate</a> and available for free.</p>

<p>The developer of the app is responding to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7ri9v8/our_monero_wallet_called_cakewallet_for_ios_is/">user feedback on Reddit</a> and will opensource the codebase of Cakewallet soon.</p>
