I"<p>Here is an excerpt from the <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC">Bitfinex</a> <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/223/review">announcement</a>:</p>

<p>In the event of a hard fork that results in a chain split, Bitfinex is also faced with the challenge of resolving peer-to-peer financing issues. Because we have sufficient time to plan for this event we have elected to handle the accounting of peer-to-peer financed trading similar to how stock spinoffs, dividends, and distributions are handled in equity markets.</p>

<p>Specifically, in the case of a hard fork event, <strong>lenders will receive both BTC and B2X</strong>. Anyone that is <strong>short BTC/USD or long any BTC trading pair (ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, etc.) will owe B2X</strong> to the lender, effectively making the user short B2X.</p>

<p>An exception is being made where <strong>BTC is borrowed but is not in use</strong> as financing collateral. In that case, <strong>B2X will accrue to the lender, [not the borrower]</strong>. Users that are financed long BTC/USD or short any BTC trading pair will receive B2X.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC">Bitfinex</a> staff will be available on <strong>Whalepool Teamspeak and Bitcoin Mumble</strong> servers from time to time to answer customer questions. We will also be building a FAQ document to clarify edge cases and other nuances as needed.</p>

<p>In case you missed the news, you can now also trade chain-split tokens (CST) for SegWit2X - or at least follow their price action for price discovery information.</p>
