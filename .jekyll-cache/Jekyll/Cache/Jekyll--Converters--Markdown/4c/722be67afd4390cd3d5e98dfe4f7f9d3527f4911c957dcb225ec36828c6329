I"×<p><strong>Pattern trading</strong>, or <strong>formation trading</strong>, refers to making trading decisions based on standard chart patterns.</p>

<p>You will most often see pattern trading on â€œslowerâ€ markets such as stock markets, and a lot of crypto traders use formation trading as well. Again, usually on the â€œslowerâ€, large cap crypto markets.</p>

<p>Pattern trading is notoriously linked with retail traders who go with someone elseâ€™s advice because they donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing, and often lose. Specifically, vague patterns like â€œhead &amp; shouldersâ€ are often mentioned in this way.</p>

<p>The fault lies not in the market patterns themselves though, it is in the way they are used.</p>
