<h4 id="whats-peerplays">What’s Peerplays</h4>

<p>Peerplays aim to work as a betting platform. Because it’s on the blockchain, it will be available from all countries. Users place a bet, the bet is processed on the blockchain (it’s a dapp), profits are distributed via PPY - the Peerplays profit sharing tokens.</p>

<p>It is an interesting concept, except the red flag that comes with everything that is <em>the UBER of [industry]</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Peerplays will eliminate the need for traditional bookies in their sports betting.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is this problem with people who keep coming back to estabilished bookies because everyone keeps coming back to estabilished bookies. Peerplays would require people to trust a dapp and it would require them to work with a dapp, that’s two very new things.</p>

<p>But who knows. The Bookie app that should enable betting is not going to be out before November 2017.</p>

<p>However unlikely, maybe it will be sports betting made simple, and maybe the network effect will not play out because that’s a more substantial thing with poker rooms and trading platforms - places where you need other people to come by otherwise the experience sucks. Sports betting is something you do on your own, after all.</p>

<p>Either way, this is what everyone likes to hear preferentially these days: <strong>Peerplays is a divident paying token</strong>. Yay!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peerplays Makes HODLing Profitable with Automatic Fee-Sharing Distributions: “Peerplays is aiming to be the first truly Decentralized Autonomous Cooperative (DAC) [...] With this new profit sharing module, all the <strong>fees that Peerplays charges</strong> for smart contract operations and peer-to-peer wagering will be <strong>distributed directly to the holders of the core Peerplays blockchain tokens</strong>, just like a traditional co-op pays <strong>dividends to its shareholders</strong>.” <a href="https://steemit.com/peerplays/@cryptoprometheus/peerplays-makes-hodling-profitable-with-automatic-fee-sharing-distributions">- via steem</a></p>
