<p>When spoken, mewn sounds the same as moon. This new variation is used mostly in trollboxes, in the <a href="http://bit.ly/at-tvd-eth">TradingView</a> crypto chat, on forums or in Telegram groups.</p>

<p>Mewn came to existence after most of the above listed places implemented auto-banning bot based on restricted phrases. â€œMoonâ€ was one of the words that would trigger ban, because during market action many users would spam the chat with exuberant shouts of â€œTo the moon!â€, making actual conversation impossible.</p>
