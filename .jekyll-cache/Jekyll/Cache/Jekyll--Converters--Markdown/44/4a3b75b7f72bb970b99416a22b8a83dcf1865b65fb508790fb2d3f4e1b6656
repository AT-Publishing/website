<h2 id="ledger-discount-code-july-2020-nano-x-20-off">Ledger Discount Code July 2020: Nano X <strong>20% OFF</strong></h2>

<p><span class="star-rating">‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</span></p>

<p>Ledger wallet opened up a <strong>discount code</strong> offer called ‚ÄúCoin League‚Äù valid until <strong>July 16th 2020</strong>.</p>

<p>You get a list of 79 discount codes to choose from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each code is giving you 20% off Ledger Nano X (the discount doesn‚Äôt add up)</li>
  <li>Each code also represents a vote for your favorite coin. Example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Coinleague-EOS</code> (/s).</li>
  <li>By using a selected code to buy Ledger Nano X, you vote for your favorite coin.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://bit.ly/2AqVG9p" class="btn">Get your Nano X 20% Discount</a>
</p>

<h3 id="its-useful-to-have-multiple-hardware-wallets">It‚Äôs useful to have multiple hardware wallets!</h3>

<p>The best way to make use of the Ledger discount code deal is to have as big a total bill as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can buy Ledger Nano X to use as your cold-ish storage. The Ledger Nano X is a Bluetooth¬Æ enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.</li>
  <li>Ledger Nano S is cheaper but can pretty much operate with a single crypto on it only, due to the small memory. That makes it ideal for a single-purpose wallet.</li>
  <li>So, if you trade mostly with, say, Bitcoin as your base currency, Ledger Nano S is the most time-, cost- and security-efficient wallet to serve as your trading wallet.</li>
</ul>

<p>It‚Äôs also useful to have a separate wallet for the darknetmarkets. Speaking purely hypothetically of course.</p>

<div id="special"></div>

<h2 id="early-black-friday-offers-2019">Early Black Friday Offers 2019</h2>

<p>Now that crypto hardware wallets and charting apps have been around for a few years, this is not our first rodeo.</p>

<p>It is known what traders can anticipate for Black Friday deals from TradingView or Ledger wallet, and whether there are any offers that will get you Black Friday value before Black Friday 2019.</p>

<p>In 2019, just as every year, the most demanded crypto trading services and products come up with interesting bundle and discount offers in the weeks leading up to Black Friday 2019, just to get the attention of the crypto crowd.</p>

<h4 id="ledger-nano-x-pre-blackfriday-to-the-moon-discount">Ledger Nano X Pre-BlackFriday: ‚ÄúTo the Moon‚Äù Discount</h4>

<p><span class="star-rating">‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ</span></p>

<p><strong>Ledger confirmed that the Black Friday offers for 2019 start on November 25 with early offers leading up to the actual Black Friday November 29 and ending the week of offers on the Cyber Monday which is December 2nd.</strong></p>

<p>Before this start of the Black Friday week, Ledger is <em>for the last few days</em> offering the <strong>Nano X</strong> wallets with a special ‚ÄúTo the moon‚Äù engraving.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong>: The engraving is not just for vanity. It‚Äôs also good to tell your devices apart, if you have multiple. These will not be restocked, so it‚Äôs a rare chance to get one like this.</p>

<p>Ledger Nano X is a new product, and as you know, newly launched tech toys normally do not get on sale. Ledger is currently only offering a discount package called the <a href="https://hodlerscashback.com/ledger-wallet-bundle/">Backup Pack that bundles Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to save on the new Ledger Nano X wallet but don‚Äôt care for the Backup Pack, your only option is to get the <a href="https://hodlerscashback.com/ledger-wallet/">3% Ledger Nano X Cashback</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not much, but it sure is better than nothing.</p>

<p>If you already have a Ledger Nano X but want another one because you hold more altcoins that fits into the wallet‚Äôs memory, get the new <a href="http://bit.ly/2oa15vh">‚ÄúTo the Moon‚Äù edition of Ledger Nano X</a> - this way you will be able to tell the wallets apart.</p>

<p>If you access Ledger wallet‚Äôs shop through <a href="https://hodlerscashback.com/hi/#shop">Hodler‚Äôs Cashback</a>, you‚Äôll still get cashback on your bill even with the new ‚ÄúTo the Moon‚Äù edition of Ledger Nano X.</p>

<h4 id="tradingview-pro-pre-blackfriday-pay-in-bitcoin">TradingView PRO Pre-BlackFriday: Pay in Bitcoin</h4>

<p><span class="star-rating">‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</span></p>

<p>TradingView has an offer for crypto traders to promote their new payment option - Bitcoin. Previously, you were only able to pay your TradingView PRO with Paypal but since February 2019, a BTC payment option is added.</p>

<p>The price for the <strong>unlimited TradingView</strong> subscription with bitcoin payments is <strong>fixed at 0.09 BTC per year</strong>, and so the USD price for your TradingView PRO varies with the changes in BTCUSD price.</p>

<p><b>Go to the TradingView crypto offer <a href="http://bit.ly/tradingview-moon" rel="nofollow">TradingView Deal</a> and see how much discount you‚Äôll be getting.</b></p>

<h4 id="ledger-nano-s-black-friday-sale-up-to-50-off-hardware-wallets">Ledger Nano S Black Friday Sale: up to 50% OFF hardware wallets</h4>

<p><span class="star-rating">‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</span></p>

<p>In 2018, Ledger Wallet opened with the first crypto-related <strong>early bird deal</strong>, 20% off on <em>Ledger Nano S</em> ordered between October 17 - October 22.</p>

<p>This campaign was followed on October 31 with a <strong>limited edition Ledger Wallet</strong>, themed for the 10 year anniversary of the Satoshi white-paper.</p>

<p>Through November 2018, Ledger was running a pre-BlackFriday promo for bulk orders on their <strong>special color edition</strong>.</p>

<p>The point of making the most popular cryptocurrency wallet available in 6 different colors was to <strong>make it easier to admin</strong>. With Nano S you can hardly ever use enough wallet apps in a single device, so it has value to be actually able to <strong>tell your hardware wallets apart</strong>.</p>

<p>The bulk offer was quite standard for Ledger:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>20% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 1 Color Edition
30% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 2 or more Color Edition
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The early bird offers were finished off with a flat 50% discount on Ledger Nano S.</p>

<p><strong>Originally, we were anticipating a bundled offer for the Ledger Nano X, but Ledger confirmed in a message to their affiliates that there will be site-wide discounts through Black Friday week 2019.</strong></p>

<p>They didn‚Äôt share any details but if site-wide is really site-wide, you should be able to get Ledger Nano X with a good amount of money off even if you just want to get a single wallet.</p>

<h5 id="about-ledger-nano-x">About Ledger Nano X</h5>

<p>The Ledger Nano X is a Bluetooth¬Æ enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.</p>

<p>Ledger Wallet used to do the Black Friday offer of <strong>21% off on your Ledger Ledger Nano S</strong> but in Black Friday 2018, they released several early-bird offers finishing with a 50% discount.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether that was a one-off event due to the crypto bear market or due to their launch of <a href="http://bit.ly/ledger-nano-x">Ledger Nano X</a> device in early 2019.</p>

<p>It is expected that due to the increasing competition and also the wider product range at Ledger <strong>the higher discount will repeat for Black Friday 2019</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="why-go-pro-on-tradingview-tradingview-pro-vs-pro">Why go PRO on TradingView: TradingView PRO vs PRO+</h4>

<p>You can keep using TradingView FREE forever but you can only save a one single chart. That means you can only watch one market at a time, nothing like BTCUSD nect to ETHUSD. Additionally, you have no access to intraday spread (looking into arbitrage opportunities between different fiat denominations on shorter timeframes than 1D) and the number of indicators or scripts per chart is limited to 3. That is perhaps bbands, ichimoku cloud and MACD and you cannot even volume color your candles.</p>

<p>With the PRO+ plan you can save 4 layouts and access them from 2 devices, you get 30 server side alerts for either price targets or indicator value targets. You have the allowance of 10 strategies or indicators per chart.</p>

<p>TradingView is the most popular charting and alert tool for cryptocurrency traders to this day. It is reliable, it doesn‚Äôt take up as much memory as cryptowatch and if you are willing to block 100+ people in the chat, you will find the community stunning. (Just kidding.

<h3 id="coinigy-black-friday-deal">Coinigy Black Friday Deal</h3>

<p>Coinigy is great for true altcoin traders who want to be the market makers in new markets, who want to leverage arb opportunities and need to stay up to date about opening markets.</p>

<p>It is not only a charting engine but also an API interface you can use to access your exchange account without using the crypto exchange web interface, which is usually terrible with the exception of <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC">Bitfinex</a> and <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/register/iYQB44">BitMEX</a>.</p>

<p>Coinigy doesn‚Äôt charge any additional fee for executing trades via the platform.</p>

<p>The subscription plans prices differ based on the length of your subscription but on Black Friday, you can get a lifetime plan for as little as 3 USD a month. That‚Äôs pretty much for free, and you get great charting engine, the possibility to trade on multiple exchanges from a single interface and notifications about new markets going live.</p>
