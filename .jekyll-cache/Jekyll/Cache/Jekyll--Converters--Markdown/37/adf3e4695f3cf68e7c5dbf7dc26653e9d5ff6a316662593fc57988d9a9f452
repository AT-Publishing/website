<h4>What is Cryptosteel</h4>

<p>Cryptosteel is a steel metal cryptocurrency wallet brand. The hardware wallet products are similar to [Billfodl](#live-billfodl) - they are also stainless steel plates for your wallet's seedphrase, waterproof, rustproof, impactproof and fireproof.
</p>
<p>Cryptosteel is a European company though, while Billfodl ships from the US, so just choose either of them based on your location.
