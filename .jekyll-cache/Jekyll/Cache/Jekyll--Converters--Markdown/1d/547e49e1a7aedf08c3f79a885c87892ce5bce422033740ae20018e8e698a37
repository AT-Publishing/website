<h2 id="what-are-tensorcharts">What are Tensorcharts?</h2>

<p>TensorCharts are an advanced charting platform servicing crypto traders. It has tools like candle footprint, orderbook heatmap or trades counter. </p>
<p>TensorCharts run on free and premium subscription models. Create your free TensorCharts account <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://tensorcharts.com/?r=14">here</a></p>

<p>The idea of <a href="https://tensorcharts.com/?r=14">TensorCharts</a> is similar to the one behind <a href="https://footprintchart.com/">Footprint Charts</a>. The charts that will let you â€œsee inside the barsâ€ as their slogan says, and unlike many marketing catchphrases, this one actually fits.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s an advanced charting tool particularly good for daytraders and scalpers on the legacy markets. You can request a free demo of the Footprint Charts app <a href="https://marketdelta.com/solutions/footprint-charts/">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="difference-between-tensorcharts-vs-footprintcharts">Difference between Tensorcharts vs Footprintcharts</h4>

<p>With footprint chart you see the regular candlestick chart candle split into steps on the price axis (such as into steps by 100 USD). This way you get to see the exact amount of money traded on which price level.</p>

<p>Each footprint chart block is colored and has a number inside - the number of dollars that was traded in that block.</p>

<p>Tensor Charts, a web app developed originally for crypto, draw from a similar idea. With Tensor Chart you get different granularity of information, depending on much you zoom in.</p>

<p>That is actually a feature: It prevents the analysis paralysis.</p>

<p>The price blocks at Tensor Charts are always colored at a scale based on the volume traded there, zoom in and youâ€™ll get the traded money as well.</p>

<p>Basically, it is similar to a far more precise <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/script/EHTKtnIt-ST-Volume-Flow-v6/">volume flow script</a>.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s not all though. In addition to the traded footprint, TensorCharts also provide a whole host of other advanced crypto trading tools.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-orderbook-heatmap">What is Orderbook Heatmap</h4>

<p>Hereâ€™s what I mean: Even in the basic free tier, TensorCharts provide the famous orderbook heatmap.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the orderbook visualization good for? Let me explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The price action, and therefore the market, is made by executed orders.</li>
  <li>Executed orders are displayed as green and red blocks for filled buys and sells. On a standard chart theese would be green and red candlesticks.</li>
  <li>The buy support and sell resistance is practically enforced by limit orders waiting on either side of the market. These are shown in shades of blue and yellow, distinguished by their size.</li>
</ul>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.altcointrading.net/features/tensor/tensor5.png" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more"><figure class="border"><amp-img itemprop="image" src="https://www.altcointrading.net/features/tensor/tensor5.png" alt="TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more" layout="responsive" width="700px" height="360px"></amp-img></figure></a></p>

<p>You can customize your orderbook heatmap through settings and decide how granular the data should be.</p>

<h4 id="see-the-spoofers-thanks-to-orderbook-heatmap">See the spoofers thanks to orderbook heatmap</h4>

<p>The orderbook heatmap function makes it easy to discover buy and sell walls. You will also just as easily see if the walls get pulled or if they execute. If you have been crypto trading for a bit, you know that spoofers like to paint support and resistance only to cancel their orders just before they would get filled.</p>

<p>To see a spoofer on a candlestick chart you really need to stop staring at the chart, open up the full orderbook and meditate for a while.</p>

<p>Then, once the orders get pulled, there is no information left about them in the books.</p>

<p>Contrary to that, Tensor Charts record this event as the past orders remain recorded in the heatmap after the candle close.</p>

<h4 id="intermittent-support-and-resistance-for-your-5-min-trading-strategies">Intermittent support and resistance for your 5-min trading strategies</h4>

<p>Even when there are no spoofers though, the Tensor Chartsâ€™ heatmap also provides an idea about intermittent support and resistance levels.</p>

<p>You can clearly see the areas with most money in open orders at a single glance.</p>

<p>Here for instance significant buys on BCH markets:</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.altcointrading.net/features/tensor/tensor4.png" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more"><figure class="border"><amp-img itemprop="image" src="https://www.altcointrading.net/features/tensor/tensor4.png" alt="TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more" layout="responsive" width="700px" height="360px"></amp-img></figure></a></p>

<h4 id="differences-in-strength-between-several-altcoins">Differences in strength between several altcoins</h4>

<p>Last but not least, the differences between various cryptocurrency markets also become apparent fairly quickly.</p>

<p>This 5M tensor chart of the ETHUSD market shows a lot of small orders, some of them coinciding into a resistance level:</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.altcointrading.net/features/tensor/tensor9.png" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more"><figure class="border"><amp-img itemprop="image" src="https://www.altcointrading.net/features/tensor/tensor9.png" alt="TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more" layout="responsive" width="700px" height="360px"></amp-img></figure></a></p>

<p>On this BTCUSD 5M chart you see the differences in order sizes are more marked, there are a few key levels with huge orders but the rest of the orders filling the space in between is of quite insignificant size in comparison:</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.altcointrading.net/features/tensor/tensor7.png" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more"><figure class="border"><amp-img itemprop="image" src="https://www.altcointrading.net/features/tensor/tensor7.png" alt="TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more" title="AltcoinTrading.NET - TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more" layout="responsive" width="700px" height="360px"></amp-img></figure></a></p>

<p>Thereâ€™s lot more that you can do with TensorCharts, I encourage you to explore their <a href="https://docs.tensorcharts.com/docs/counters_ratio/">documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-you-get-in-tensorcharts-free-plan">What you get in TensorCharts FREE Plan</h3>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://tensorcharts.com/?r=14">TensorCharts</a> are available free with basic functions pulling data from the most popular exchange APIs: Bitfinex, Binance, GDAX, BitStamp, BitMEX. In the free plan you get 5M and 1H timeframes, orderbook heatmap and trades counter.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to create a user account.</p>

<p>If you like working with orderbook heatmaps and only <a href="/technical-analysis/">basic indicators like bbands</a> or <a href="/strategy/fibs">fibs</a>, Tensorcharts are far better than the currently most popular free charting app Cryptowatch.</p>

<h3 id="tensorcharts-pro-plans">TensorCharts PRO Plans</h3>

<p>Paid plans went live on September 18th 2018, one year to day since the development of the TensorCharts app started.</p>

<p>Plans range from 8 USD - 25 USD per month, paid only in crypto.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-tensor-charts">How to use Tensor Charts</h3>

<p>We have a <strong>whole section for <a href="/tensorcharts-tutorials/">TensorCharts Tutorials</a></strong> but if you donâ€™t want to go there just now, below a couple of walkthrough videos on YouTube (cca 1 minute each).</p>

<h2 id="summary-powerful-tool">Summary: Powerful Tool</h2>

<p>TensorCharts have come a long way since we first published a post about them in January 2018.</p>

<p>As the development advanced, programmable indicators were added along with experimental indicators such as the <a href="https://docs.tensorcharts.com/docs/counters_ratio/">Counters Ratio</a>.</p>

<p><strong>TensorCharts are now beating both Cryptowatch and TradingView</strong> in terms of the amount of information (and therefore edge) you can extract from them.</p>

<p>We were probably the first blog to call for paid plans, this kind of tool should not be available for free.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re happy the paid plans are here, it could help with the only issue Tensor Charts traders keep complaining about: That during abrupt price action you can only hope the server wonâ€™t get too overloaded. Iâ€™d argue itâ€™s still not as bad as when you get this on BitMEX though.</p>

<p>Still, even the free version of Tensor Charts can give you quite a good edge if you use it right.</p>
