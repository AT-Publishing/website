I"c<p>In crypto, the <strong>Bart Formation</strong>, or just Bart, is a chart pattern where the cryptocurrency market rallies sharply, usually on a shorter timeframe like 30M, and after a period of flat (<a href="/glossary/sideways/">sideways</a>) action retraces <em>all of its previous gains</em>.</p>

<p>The name Bart came from the pattern’s likeness to the shape of Bart Simpson’s head.</p>

<h4 id="what-does-the-bart-pattern-mean">What does the Bart pattern mean</h4>

<p>On bitcoin markets, the Bart shows up only after long periods of sideways. In those times the volumes decline and not much is happening on the markets.</p>

<p>On altcoin markets, where thin order books are normal, you can still see Barts quite often.</p>

<p>Considering this kind of market environment, what does the Bart pattern mean?</p>

<p>The idea behind the Bart pattern is that there was an attempt to start a run-up in the market. It could have been done by a single actor or by means of organic uncoordinated speculation, that doesn’t really matter.</p>

<p>The important information is that this attempt did not catch on. Bart is a signal of relative weakness on the market: The speculation is trying to get ahead of the market.</p>

<h3 id="trading-the-bart-pattern">Trading the Bart Pattern</h3>

<p>Bart pattern is always a “failed attempt” at something: Either a failed attempt at starting a run-up after a <a href="/glossary/sideways/">sideways</a> period, or a failed attempt at building a bottom after a down trend.</p>

<p>Quite typically, crypto markets will show bart patterns at the end of a channel or triangle formation that has been in the making for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Ends of triangular formations are in particular a good place to spot bart formations, because the <strong>volume there is getting lower</strong> - a lot of traders go to the sidelines, waiting for a decisive move.</p>

<p>The same is also true at the end of a bear market or when the market was <a href="/glossary/sideways/">ranging</a> for so long that everyone is bored and nobody wants to trade.</p>

<p>Does that make the Bart formation after a flat period a good place to long?</p>

<p><strong>Only if your risk tolerance is high.</strong></p>

<p>Remember that Bart is a <em>failed</em> attempt at starting a run-up. There was some follow through, but not enough yet. The market needs to build up the momentum a little longer, and in the meantime a fundamental event can happen that changes everything … In other words, there is no way to time the market from the presence of Bart patterns alone.</p>

<p>However, it does show some early confidence on the market.</p>

<p>So, those are the options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the market is failing to establish bottom, it is too early to be bullish. You may have better odds in short-term short positions, but you need to consider other technical analysis, such as support and resistance lines.</li>
  <li>It is a super bad time to speculate with futures or any other time-limited contracts. With plain leverage though, the story is different. You could use contracts like the Bitmex <strong>perpetual swap</strong> to try and catch longing the next Bart. Shorting it is more risky if the overall structure of the market looks like slowly setting up for a run-up.</li>
  <li>If there is a Bart on the hourly charts but you are normally looking at the D and W charts and your opinion there is bullish, you could buy <strong>spot</strong> for the mid- to long-term.</li>
</ul>
