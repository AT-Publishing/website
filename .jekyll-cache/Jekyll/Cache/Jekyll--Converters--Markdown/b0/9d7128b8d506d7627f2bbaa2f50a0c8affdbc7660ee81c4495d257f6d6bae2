I"Ã<p>Tether has issued an emergency notice stating that more than 30 millions of newly generated tethers have been stolen by an unknown malicious hacker.</p>

<p>The Tether hack will need to be reported to law enforcement which was the reason why <a href="https://twitter.com/AMuse1512/status/941730603535425536">ChrisJ removed the warrant canaries from his Twitter account</a> - an event that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7k5asc/bitfinex_employee_removes_warrant_canaries_from/">left people wondering</a> whether Bitfinex is under subpoena.</p>

<p>On the notice, the price of some cryptocurrencies dropped sharply (mainly BTC and also IOTA, which is mostly traded at Bitfinex, company related to Tether via Tetherâ€™s owning company). The markets have since seen a recovery.</p>
