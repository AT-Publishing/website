<p>Decentralized games are facing the same challenge as the rest of the dApp industry - declining user base. As <a href="http://diar.co/decentralized-apps-facing-half-life-after-peak/">reported by diar.co</a>, even the most popular decentralized game CryptoKitties suffered a decline of 96% in terms of active users measured by unique active ETH addresses. The reason for poor user retention according to Diar is unintuitive multi-step user experience, a crucial issue that even in the future could make finding new adopters difficult.</p>

<p>An intuitive solution <a href="https://www.altcointrading.net/interview-andrew-gazdecki/">also highlighted by Andrew Gazdecki of Altcoin.io</a> is sharing of liquidity: Blockchain projects should not silo their apps, they should instead engage in liquidity pooling and support collaboration among different blockchain assets.</p>

<p>The blockchain game <a href="https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/company/etheremon/">Etheremon</a> is the first decentralized gaming platform that made this step to make the dApp game more accessible and partnered with <a href="https://kyber.network/">Kyber Network</a>. The integration launched on Tuesday 18th September 2018 at noon UTC.</p>

<h4 id="leveraging-kyber-network-in-blockchain-gaming">Leveraging Kyber Network in Blockchain Gaming</h4>

<p>Kyber Network developed an on-chain liquidity protocol that allows decentralized token swaps to be integrated into any application.</p>

<p>Kyber Network supports atomic token swaps with immediate settlement, effectively removing transaction waiting time. With this integration value exchange can be performed seamlessly between all parties in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>While the one application that comes first in mind is decentralized trading, in the most general way Kyber Network makes it possible to use any ERC-20 token where a platform-specific token would otherwise be necessary.</p>

<p>In the world of game dApps where every game has its own in-game currency this is a substantial improvement in usability for users who play more than one blockchain game.  Kyber Network integration means they can access gaming dApps using any ERC-20 token, no need to hold and manage segregated in-game funds for each dApp game they play.</p>

<p>It is expected among the most popular tokens to use in Etheremon will be <a href="https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/company/zilliqa/">Zilliqa (ZIL)</a> and Basic Attention Token (BAT).</p>

<h4 id="advantage-in-the-crowded-blockchain-gaming-industry">Advantage in the Crowded Blockchain Gaming Industry</h4>

<p>According to DappRadar.com, decentralized games are among the most popular dApps overall. CryptoKitties currently rank fourth and Etheremon fifth on the <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapps">leaderboard of all dApps on the Ethereum blockchain</a>.</p>

<p>As of September 2018 the <a href="https://dappradar.com/category/games">total number of active dApp games is around 350</a>. This demonstrates not only the soaring engagement with blockchain from the gaming community but also the increasing competitiveness of the blockchain gaming industry.</p>

<p>Making the game token management easier could quickly prove to be a strong advantage. With no need to exchange tokens, users are ready to play at any time they decide so. Thanks to Kyberâ€™s atomic swaps with instant settlement there is no waiting time necessary as there would be with the traditional token exchange methods.</p>

<p><strong>In the business of entertainment, it is risky to let the playerâ€™s interest wane in wait for transaction confirmation. And conversely: When deciding between several dApp games, we could see players prioritize the most accessible one.</strong></p>
