#### About Bitfinex

Bitfinex is a custodial crypto trading platform that provides spot trading, leveraged trading and crypto futures trading.

Unlike exchanges such as [Independent Reserve](/coupon-independent-reserve/), Bitfinex is really a platform catering towards active traders. It has a full featured interface with all you need for [daytrading](/daytrading/) spot or futures market in crypto, and the same data-rich UI for the lending market.

On the other hand, Bitfinex doesn't provide as high leverage as [BitMEX](/coupon-bitmex-iyqb44/) and is *not* focused primarily on derivatives, which means the crowd on Bitfinex is less focused on very short-term speculation. Margin cascades are rare.

The user interface on Bitfinex has embedded charts from [TradingView PRO](https://bit.ly/at-tvd-btcusd). The charts offer wide range of indicators for technical analysis.

##### Bitfinex as a Company

As a company, Bitfinex as well as its related companies is based in British Virgin Islands under *iFinex*.

Bitfinex exchange was hacked in August 2016.

Despite the hack it managed to retain a wide user base thanks to its powerful trading interface for desktop and also its great [Bitfinex mobile app](/bitfinex-app/).

* Bitfinex offers a wide range of markets denominated in USD, EUR, JPY from the fiat choices and BTC, ETH, EOS and many more for the crypto pairs.
* Tether markets as well as withdrawals are available, but dollar pairs on Bitfinex trade against USD, not Tether.
* Margin markets are funded via a public P2P lending system. Identity verification is not needed for lending.
* Bitfinex opened a derivatives section of the platform in September 2019.

The Bitfinex exchange is available worldwide. There is limitation on margin trade for Americans - however the exchange is still operational from American IP address. New users on US IP just have to state they are not American residents.

**No KYC is needed** other than for fiat deposit/withdrawal. There might be restrictions for Bitfinex futures markets based on your location.

#### About DeversiFi (formerly ETHFinex, EOSFinex)

Bitfinex has been dabbing into non-custodial trading. Their first venture there was EthFinex, a non-custodial DEX for ETH-based trading.

Ethfinex.com was discontinued since 12 October 2019 and all non-custodial trading moved on to DeversiFi.

**DeversiFi** is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that runs on that enables trading of tokens and any other cryptocurrency (even BTC) in it's 'wrapped' form.

The platform is owned and maintained by the same company as the Bitfinex exchange, but offers non-custodial crypto trading: **On DeversiFi, you trade crypto directly from your [hardware or software cryptocurrency wallet](/altcoin-wallets/) without any signup**.

#### Bitfinex Verification Levels

Getting verified on Bitfinex is **not necessary for most traders**, but comes with advantages even if you do not want to deposit or withdraw fiat money.

##### Intermediate Level Verification on Bitfinex

*Requires two government IDs or one ID and a Skype video call. Also requires utility bill for address proof, no older than 90 days.*

Intermediate level verification gives you a more seamless crypto experience on Bitfinex. It does not entitle you to deposit and withdraw fiat, but it does entitle you to deposit and withdraw Tether.

* Access to airdrops and giveaways

Getting verified to at least intermediate level opens up the possibility for you to participate in **[airdrops](/airdrops/)** that Bitfinex runs to promote new token launches on the platform.

* Faster cryptocurrency deposits

Verified users can trade deposited cryptocurrency faster, **fewer confirmations** are required before their deposit is credited.

* Access to exchange token

Bitfinex has their own exchange token (LEO) that can generate **fee discount** on other tokens for you.

##### Full Level Verification on Bitfinex

*Requires bank statement, but only your first deposit must come from that account.*

Full verification on Bitfinex entitles you to all benefits of the intermediate level, plus fiat deposits and withdrawals.

This is the only way in which Bitfinex still has minimum deposit requirement - you can only move **fiat that is worth at least 10k USD**.
