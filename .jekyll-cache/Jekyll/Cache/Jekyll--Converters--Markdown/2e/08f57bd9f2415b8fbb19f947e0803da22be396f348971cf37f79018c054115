<p>Bollinger bands are often used on forex markets, aside from crypto markets. They work well on markets that trade in pairs, such as currencies.</p>

<p>The reason for this fit is the fact that <strong>bbands are in fact a moving average with two standard deviations on either side</strong>.</p>

<p>Which means the information bbands are giving you when the price action ventures out of them is basically: <em>“this ratio shot up a bit more then usuall - it might shoot back some time soon, but then it also might not”</em>.</p>

<p>And so, now you can hopefully stop treating John Bollinger like a demi-god.</p>
