<p>Through November 2018, Ledger was running two pre-BlackFriday promo campaigns.</p>

<p>First 2018 Pre-BlackFriday Promo: <strong>Bundle of Nano S color edition</strong></p>

<p>Ledger made the Nano S available in 6 different colors to address the most common complaint about the Nano S - that its memory is so small that you cannot run multiple wallet apps on it at the same time.</p>

<p>Having different Ledger wallets in different colors proved to make your crypto storage easier to admin. You could actually tell the wallets of different coins apart.</p>

<p>The bundle offer for colored Ledger Nano S had a standard discount structure:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>20% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 1 Color Edition
30% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 2 or more Color Edition
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second 2018 Pre-BlackFriday Promo: <strong>Flat Nano S discount</strong></p>

<p>The early bird offers of 2018 were finished off with a flat 50% discount on Ledger Nano S.</p>
