<p>Coins4Favors (C4F) is a peer-to-peer marketplace facilitating mini-jobs paid for with FavorCoins (ERC20). The core of the project is the C4F app with GPS location matching and blockchain-based escrow. The app together with the borderless property of paying with cryptocurrency aims to disrupt the gig economy.</p>

<p><a href="https://coins4favors.com/">The Platform Homepage</a></p>

<p>With 2.5 billion smartphone users, C4F is betting on the tokenization of simple daily tasks in the realtime. A blockchain-powered marketplace with its in-house cryptocurrency traded on major exchanges has the advantage of not needing expensive financial processing, payments for tasks are similar to game tokens and their exchange into fiat currencies is handled off-platform. Combined with automatic escrow run by a smart contract that is released once the task is marked completed and with the precise GPS locator in the app, C4F can target even small favors that undeniably have value but have not been monetized yet: „I will be	in street	X	in 15	minutes	– keep a parking spot	available	for	me“ or „Take a picture for me in	a	remote location“.</p>

<p>The main goals the the Coins4Favors platform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a world-wide marketplace for favors, use the GPS locator to avoid making the search for job or contractor tedious and confusing.</li>
  <li>Instant borderless payments facilitated by cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for fiat off-platform.</li>
  <li>Trust between service provider and customer not needed, payments handled by escrow.</li>
  <li>Community-driven rating system and dispute resolution - acting as a judge will also be a paid favor.</li>
</ul>

<p>A working alpha version of the app already exists. At this stage it is critical for the platform to gain as big reach as possible and to have the FavorTokens listed on common cryptocurrency exchanges. Therefore the funds raised in the crowdsale are planned to be used primarily on a strong international campaign and to ensure international legal compliance.</p>
