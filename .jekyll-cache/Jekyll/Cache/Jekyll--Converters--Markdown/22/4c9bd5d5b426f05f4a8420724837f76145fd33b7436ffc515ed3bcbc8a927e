I"w<p>In crypto jargon, <strong>P2P</strong> is short for <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> or <strong>person-to-person</strong> and usually refers to a way of purchasing cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>If you purchase crypto in a P2P way, you do that directly with a counterparty; without the participation of a service provider such an exchange platform. You may have used a platform to find that counterparty, but your transaction happens between your cryptocurrency wallet and the wallet of your counterparty.</p>
