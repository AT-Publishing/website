I"Q<p>Hello there. Happy belated halvening.</p>

<p>This is just to announce a couple of new things to those who might not <a href="http://eepurl.com/cOgd6P">subscribe</a> to all the feeds.</p>

<h2 id="new-trading-strategy-post-published-on-14th-may">New Trading Strategy post published on 14th May.</h2>

<p>It’s a long read on technical analysis in crypto. Basically, it explains that you can use TA strategically, as opposed to blindly.</p>

<p>There are plenty examples to illustrate all points and technical terms link to relevant articles here on the website.</p>

<p>A list of good tools is included, again with illustrations on how to use them well.</p>

<p>It is a ‘mindset’ post, though. You will have to actually sit down and do some charting, try stuff and so on. This will just give you the right direction.</p>

<h2 id="new-glossary-section">New glossary section</h2>

<p>If you haven’t notices yet, we have a glossary of terms that the crypto newcomers probably don’t know and that, in some cases, cannot really be googled.</p>

<p>Or, they can, but the search might go kinda sideways.</p>
