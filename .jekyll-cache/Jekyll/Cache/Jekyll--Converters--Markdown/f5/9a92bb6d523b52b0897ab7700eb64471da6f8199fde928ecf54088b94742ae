<p>Conversely - if you can prove you own the keys, for all intents and purposes that also says you own the crypto.</p>

<p><strong>This verification is typically needed when you lose access to an exchange account where you were not KYC‚Äôd.</strong></p>

<h3 id="message-signature-as-a-proof">Message Signature as a proof</h3>

<p>For obvious reasons, you cannot show the private key to anyone.</p>

<p>Showing it would prove your ownership, but at the same time it would make you lose said ownership.</p>

<p>One of the established ways to prove the ownership of a private key is to sign a message with it. To sign a message you only work with the public address associated with your private keys, but you need to do it from the wallet that holds it.</p>

<p>That requires your physical access to your wallet device or laptop, and a password that decrypts the wallet and lets you use it.</p>

<h3 id="crypto-wallets-that-let-you-sign-a-message">Crypto wallets that let you sign a message</h3>

<p>Message signing has become an advanced function. Most new crypto wallets that are user friendly do not support it.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Trezor</strong>: SUPPORTS MESSAGE SIGNING
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/blackfriday/#live-billfodl">Trezor wallet‚Äôs</a> Chrome extension lets you sign a message with an address belonging to your wallet.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ledger</strong>: NO SUPPORT
    <ul>
      <li>Ledger wallet did support message signature and verification in its old web interface. The web UI us now deprecated. Ledger Live does NOT support message signing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Electrum</strong>: SUPPORTS MESSAGE SIGNING
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/glossary/electrum/">Electrum supports message signatures</a> for all address formats: legacy, P2SH segwit and bech32 native segwit. However, a lot of crypto software that deals with message verifications will not validate bech32 signatures - The format is too new.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="your-wallet-does-not-support-message-signatures">Your wallet does not support message signatures?</h3>

<p>If you have access to your wallet‚Äôs seed phrase, use it to load your wallet into Electrum.</p>

<p><strong>Here‚Äôs how to do it:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the Electrum wallet and in the File menu, select ‚ÄúNew/Restore‚Äù</li>
  <li>Select ‚ÄúStandard wallet‚Äù</li>
  <li>Select ‚ÄúAlready have a seed‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to verify ownership of a Legacy address starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type in your seed phrase</li>
  <li>Choose legacy</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to verify ownership of a P2SH Segwit address starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type in your seed phrase and click ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù</li>
  <li>Select BIP39 (ignore any warnings)</li>
  <li>Select derivation path ‚Äúp2sh-segwit‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to verify ownership of a native Segwit address starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bc1</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type in your seed phrase</li>
  <li>Choose segwit</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-if-you-still-cannot-sign-a-message">What if you still cannot sign a message?</h3>

<p>This can happen. Especially if you use native segwit address.</p>

<p>To prove your ownership, the exchange (or whoever asks) can require you to move an arbitrary (but pre-defined) amount of crypto from the address in question to any other address in your wallet.</p>

<p>You are sending money to yourself, so there is no loss (other than transaction fee). Signature is still obviously the preferred method.</p>
