<p>KYC means in crypto the same thing as it means in legacy finance industry: KYC stands for <strong>know your customer</strong>.</p>

<p>Practically, KYC will be the requirement by a crypto trading platform to get a scan of your ID card (at least). KYC is usually coupled with AML screening (anti-money-laundering).</p>

<p>Thanks to decentralized trading, in 2020 there are ways to <a href="/buy-crypto-no-kyc/">buy or trade crypto with no KYC</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We go more at length [in the blog]((/buy-crypto-no-kyc/) about what are the red flags you don’t want to see in a crypto trading platform without KYC.</p>

<p>To make the long story short, trading crypto without KYC is less risky if your exchange has a proven track of records and doesn’t limit your crypto withdrawals.</p>

<h2 id="crypto-wallet-with-no-kyc">Crypto Wallet with No KYC</h2>

<p>This is just to clarify one thing: If a cryptocurrency wallet requires you to KYC, it’s possibly a scam.</p>

<p>The only good reason for KYC is the exchange between fiat and crypto. That is why Coinbase <em>exchange</em> will want you to KYC buy Coinbase <em>wallet</em> has no good reason to.</p>

<p><a href="/airdrops/">Airdrops</a> requiring KYC are in most cases borderline scam. At best, it’s simply not worth it to give away your identity to collect couple dollar’s worth of useless token.</p>

<p>A cryptocurrency wallet is just a device to generate private keys for you. Anyone who has access to a wallet’s key has access to the wallet’s coin. <strong>Do not KYC to get a cryptocurrency wallet.</strong></p>

<p>Free and anonymous cryptocurrency wallets include:</p>
