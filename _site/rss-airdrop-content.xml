    <td>
      Users who deposit at least 1000 FET and make at least one FET/anything trade are eligible to claim a prize from the total pool of 100.000 FET. There are some strings attached this time - you have to be verified to the intermediate level and you need to be among the first 25 traders to complete the conditions each day. More info in an announcement after your signup (or login) at Bitfinex.

  <tr>
    <td>Opportunity: Negative Fees on Vaultoro Gold markets</td>
    <td>Since 22nd of July 2020</td>
    <td>
      The gold trading platform Vaultoro is now offering negative fees for market makers. The rebate is 0.05% at any traded volume, however it only applies to crypto markets there - not to gold markets. At least the gold fees got cut back to pre-COVID levels on Vaultoro.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OKEx Crypto Signup Bonus</td>
    <td>Bonus for Signup</td>
    <td>
      OKEx, formerly called OKCoin and known as OKCasino, was the BitMEX of 2015 but has fallen out of favour since. They are now running a similar campaign as Coinbase did to get their signup rates up: If you sign up and buy 100 USD worth of BTC, you get 10 USD bonus.
    </td>
    <td><a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/okex-affilatnet-2020">details</a></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Blockstack Free crypto airdrop</td>
    <td>Jan - Feb 2020</td>
    <td>
      The webwallet blockchain.com is giving away free Stack $STX crypto to their Gold users. The Gold level requires an ID scan and selfie.
    </td>
    <td><a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2FmvStN">details</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>New non-custodial anonymous peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading</td>
    <td>Opened 19 Nov 2019</td>
    <td>
      If you miss the heyday of LocalBitcoins where anyone could buy BTC locally for cash (which has been banned since this summer) and anonymously (now site-wide KYC is required, plus allegedly LocalBitcoins have been working with three-letter agencies), since 19th November you have the chance to go back in time and buy your corn without ID again - at least for some time. You know that good things like this don't last ...
       The former ETH marketplace LocalEthereum rebranded to LocalCryptos and offers local and anonymous BTC trading with fully automated escrow that is built natively on BTC blockchain - because bitcoin's smart contract scripting capabilities are good enough for simple stuff like escrows. You can even import your vendor reputation from LocalBitcoins.
       The reputation import is done via adding a unique code to your LBC profile page, not by linking anything directly, but still in case you like your privacy it's probably only a good idea id you never ID'd on LocalBitcoins.
