        <description><![CDATA[ BBands Variations on Tradingview, focusing on Bollinger Bandwidth this time. In this series we are picking and reviewing TradingView scripts for technical analysis that recently popped up in the daily popular feed. ]]></description>

Bollinger Band Width

Bollinger band width indicator (or “bandwidth”) belongs to the more straightforward derivations of the famous Bollinger bands.

The gist of the Bollinger bandwidth script is essentially plotting the information about how far apart are the Standard Deviation lines of Bollinger bands, that is, the outer bands.



Bollinger bands is a technical analysis indicator providing information about volatility that, thanks to the indicator, is displayed in such a way that it can show more clearly in which direction is the market likely to move in the nearest future:


  The middle band is a moving average, typically the SMA, therefore the current mean or “average” price.
  The outer bands are standard deviations of that mean, measuring how far the current action has the price spike out away from its mean.
  Capital markets work in cycles, a directional movement (a bull run or a bear descent) always starts after at least a short relatively stable period - that is, period of lower volatility. And the other way around - if the price is running in a trend but the bandwidth is hitting its max, some topping out or re-accumulation range could soon follow.


There are two interesting versions of Bollinger band width on Tradingview:


  Simple Bollinger Bandwidth with high/low reference that just plots the width as a line and lets you compare different time periods.
  The IO_BBWidth script that uses weighted moving average and will color the background of your line chart when the market starts trending, so that you cannot tell yourself whatever fits your bias.


Let’s take a look at the IO-BB-Width.

Full script code

Does it work?

When you first load the script into a BTCUSD chart, with the default settings you will find that it shows the market always trending. The reason is, the default setting is meant for ultra short timeframes.

You will need to backtest the coloring threshold on the timeframe of your choice, based on the near past.

Once you’ve done that though, it’s actually a pretty useful piece of info because it will show you when the current run starts running out of steam.

While it is often just to take a breather (a short period of low volatility doesn’t always mean the run is over), if you’re trading with leverage or with timing limitation (such as with derivatives), you will definitely find this information useful and not enter any new positions until the situation starts clearing up.

Here is the indicator with 21 day WAP, stdev3 and a threshold of 500 on BTCUSD 4H:



You can see it is not super precise; it’s not the kind of information you should use to trigger your getting into a position - it’s far more valuable to consult it if you are considering getting out.

On a 5M chart for BTCUSD you can use the same information in a different way - here with the threshold of 150 you can see it will highlight just the time periods that happened to be most volatile. On super short timeframes you are of course not looking for a sustainable trend, but if you’re a scalper, this information is pretty good for you.



As with longer timeframes though - you will need to backtest it.

Summary

Bollinger bandwidth indicator in its basic form provides no new information, you can get all this just from looking at the bands.

It is just a more convenient way to display it, because with bbands you are adding a lot of new lines over your price action and it can get a little crowded there.

Having the bandwidth in a separate box under the price chart also lets you plot in additional things or set up squeeze alerts, which can come handy if you are scalping.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ 
  Products of 2019


Trading

The biggest change from the 2018 stats post is probably the cool-off of BitMEX affiliate earnings.

This comes quite as a surprise: The overall volume traded on BitMEX pretty much follows the price of Bitcoin. There were no crazy bubbles in either of the past two years, but the platform did make a decent traded volume in the summer of 2019. Could it be that gamblers with 300 USD worth of stash perhaps get convinced they are winning at life with every 5% uptick? Either way - the readers of this blog apparently did not follow.

On the other hand there was a noticeable shift to Bitfinex once again, ever since they re-opened their affiliate program for the main custodial trading platform. It is almost funny considering their notorious banking issues and the whole Tether thing, but the commission patterns suggest that some people are DCA’ing there.

Additionally, since the new affiliate platform on Bitfinex pays you out in the currency spent by the referred user, let me tell you that the activity has been predominantly fiat getting spent and shitcoins getting flipped. There has been next to no selling of top-tier cryptocurrencies from the readers of this blog.

Other crypto trading platforms

Near the end of the year there have been several new products added and while it will be for the next year to see how they do, there has been some interest into the 3commas DCA bot.

Stash Management

It is no surprise that one of the biggest product hits of the year 2019 was Ledger Nano X. A new product and on top of that offered in bulk packages on several different occasions during the whole year - usually in a discount combo with a Nano S.

A lot of people bought these bulk packs especially during Black Friday but by far not only then.

From competing products, Keepkey is pretty much forgotten while Trezor does have some user base but Ledger is still the winner here.

Hardware seed-phrase storage Billfodl (and Cryptosteel for the EU analog) have been linked from here only for a small part of the year but appear to pass for vanity products rather than something to rely on.

Technical Analysis

By far the biggest hit among AltcoinTrading.NET readers during all of 2019 were the subscription plans to the charting platform TradingView!

This is something that crypto traders have been buying a lot through the whole year, and the shift from entertainment and high-leverage trading to analysis comes as a change in comparison with the past.

One of the reasons of last year’s uptick could be that TradingView started accepting subscription payments in crypto early in 2019: While for the majority of shoppers in general implementing payments in crypto is in fact an unnecessary gimmick, for us who buy, sell and move cryptocurrencies on the daily it does make things easier. - Certainly easier than trying to log into your Paypal account from a third world country.

From the perspective of the crowd around this blog I think it is safe to say that TradingView PRO is the product of 2019.

Needless to say, the interest in the more advanced platform TensorCharts has been tiny compared to TradingView.

That may be sad for the founder but then again it is obvious that learning to use the orderbook heatmap and other TensorCharts features can still give you an edge, even though the product is a couple of years old already.

Let’s see what 2020 brings!

        <title><![CDATA[ Technical Analysis in Cryptocurrency Trading ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Technical indicators work. Sometimes. Should you use technical analysis for crypto? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ This post on cryptocurrency technical analysis specifics was originally published in 2016.

Back then, it was a common debate in the TradingView chat whether technical analysis in crypto can actually work at all.

Does Technical Analysis Work in Crypto?

It was the time when the multi-year bull market in Bitcoin and most other cryptos was in its infancy, the markets were acting wild and every futures contract settlement day was filled with what Reddit dubbed the “Bart formation”: A steep rise in a single candle that doesn’t really catch on and is subsequently dumped in another single candle, or alternatively the opposite sequence known as the “inverse Bart”.



This used to be the daily bread of the BTCUSD market back in the day when it was a niche play, and it still can look this wild on small-cap altcoin markets.

In contrast to that, traders using some technical analysis tools and methods (along with healthy skepticism and well-trained judgement) have been more successful than not on the crypto markets.

The reason lies in the way technical analysis works in general.

So, how does technical analysis work at all?

Always loyal to my first trading principle:- Draw a lot of lines so it will look like you know what you are doing. pic.twitter.com/na9WaByn28&amp;mdash; via Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand)

The problematic part lies in the way technical analysis works, not only in crypto but on any kind of market in general.

Technical trading in its core is about looking for chart patterns. Chart patterns are sequences of price action that are vaguely repetitive, which means that if you notice a pattern in the making, you have slightly better odds when speculating on what the price will do next.

Technical Trading as Relying on the Machine

One aspect of technical trading relies on what could be called the mechanical capabilities of the markets.

It is reasonable to assume some resistance to change in prices, when you are looking at the chart of something that is a currency or a company stock - really very much most often the value of any real thing will not change 100% overnight.

The technical analysis play for this principle can be translated into an indicator like bbands, which in very simple terms is a median price wrapped in its standard deviations. If the price action wanders out of the standard deviations boundary, it will most often be just about the time it starts wandering back inside - unless something nonstandard is happening. Looking at overbought and oversold areas at RSIs and similar oscillators is the same idea.

Technical Trading as Relying on History

Another aspect are historical levels that form support/resistance areas.

The idea behind this focus of technical analysis is not guessing that the price is likely to do the same thing at the price level that is being revisited, the roots of support and resistance are in the basic supply/demand logic.

If there is a price level that has been clearly perceived as “too expensive” since the history shows that used to be a lot of selling at one or more points in the past, then the demand will most likely weaken around that level again in the future, and that for so long until something outside of technical analysis changes.

In some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin you could start talking about the halving here: If the supply of the asset decreases and at the same time the demand for it doesn’t decrease, at some point this will lead to rise in prices. On the charts, this will render as breaking up through a resistance zone.

The breaking up through resistance or breaking down through support can also be fully and completely a result of speculation, though. It is important to keep in mind that the price action on the charts is really just a result of the many forces acting on the market, not the gospel that defines the truth. Assets can be undervalued, assets can be overvalued.

And then there’s the one last thing to this: Support and resistance is such a popular technical analysis principle that it already takes us to the last aspect:

Technical Trading as Relying on… Technical Trading

Especially with the rare and joyful events, like when a market is making new highs and so there is no history to account for, it’s time to shine for tools like Fibonacci, known most often as “fibs”. Fibs use obscure formulas which probably border on abuse of mathematics to project price levels where the future reversals are likely to occur.

How is that useful?

Short-term traders, and there are always many, like to flow with the market in both directions. This means that they do not want to risk missing a retracement, even if a short one.

This particular type of a trader would normally look at support and resistance levels to mark for themselves the price levels where the action is likely to reverse. When they do not have resistance levels available, because the market is trending above the all-time-highs, they will use fibs.

As long as there is no new information shaking up the market, the reversal will often actually happen around the fib level, because this is the easiest and most accessible tool for people to determine a price level where they will set their take-profit orders to scale out of their positions and minimize their risk.

The profit-taking will slow down the trend and that in turn will catch the attention even of those traders who might not even know what “fibs” are.

Consequently, very often the fib will happen as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.

When Technical Analysis Doesn’t Work

If there is an unexpected important event happening, it will always shake up the markets, no matter how mature and stable they are: China bans Bitcoin? Of course. How about China banning the US Dollar, though? Of course there would be a shake-up too!

With some cryptocurrencies, the important event can be something far more prosaic, though.

Back in the day when BTC was popular enough to have semi-pro trading platforms but at the same time was still really a niche thing, the daily play was to leverage the fact that the market was small enough for people with maybe five digits USD to move it and literally buy their way.

Such a thing is still possible, there is also mostly no legal danger in doing so, because cryptocurrencies are unregulated markets.

The only thing that changed here is the amount of money and skill to paint the market the way you want it.

That is a fact and because of this technical analysis can always fail.

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;This post on cryptocurrency technical analysis specifics was originally published in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then, it was a common debate in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/tradingview-moon&quot;&gt;TradingView chat&lt;/a&gt; whether technical analysis in crypto can actually work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-technical-analysis-work-in-crypto&quot;&gt;Does Technical Analysis Work in Crypto?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the time when the multi-year bull market in Bitcoin and most other cryptos was in its infancy, the markets were acting wild and every futures contract settlement day was filled with what Reddit dubbed the “Bart formation”: A steep rise in a single candle that doesn’t really catch on and is subsequently dumped in another single candle, or alternatively the opposite sequence known as the “inverse Bart”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/bart-formation-crypto.png&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Technical Analysis in Cryptocurrency Trading&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/bart-formation-crypto.png&quot; alt=&quot;Technical Analysis in Cryptocurrency Trading&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Technical Analysis in Cryptocurrency Trading&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This used to be the daily bread of the BTCUSD market back in the day when it was a niche play, and it still can look this wild on small-cap altcoin markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to that, traders using some technical analysis tools and methods (along with healthy skepticism and well-trained judgement) have been more successful than not on the crypto markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason lies in the way technical analysis works in general.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Daytrading on Crypto Markets: Good Idea? ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Daytrading means entering and exiting the market in a single day. Is this a good crypto trading strategy? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Daytrading is quite a broad term for the style of trading that has you enter and exit the market during a single trading session, preferably in profit.

You can be a daytrader if you engage in scalping crypto, most types of arbitrage also fall into daytrading but you can in fact aim for larger swings on the crypto markets that will need several hours to develop.

In the latter case, the border between swing trading and day trading gets a little blurry, since bitcoin market hours are 24/7/365.

You probably get the idea, though: You daytrade crypto when you flip in and out of a position within a few hours.

Daytrading in crypto: The Psychology Aspect

Daytrading crypto is indeed possible, but be aware that it is really a good fit only to some type of personalities.


  If you daytrade, you need to sit down glued to the chart until your trade reaches completion.
  Oh yeah, you need to actually have this planned quite strategically: What do you do in every possible market structure - close, wait, stop, take profit. There isn’t room for emotion or hesitating.
  There was the magic word: Stop-Loss. You will probably want to use automatic stop loss, which means you will get stop-hunted. So if you are looking for a personal development project, try building up your strength of character to such level that you will be able to quit a losing trade without automatic stop, just on alert.


Aside from the psychology of the trader which must be compatible with this style of trade execution, let’s now look at some basic rules of the job.

Go for smaller profits

If you want to close your position as soon as possible and with profit, don’t look for huge profit from every single trade.

You might find those in illiquid markets, such as when a new coin is released with much hype and the trading just opens, or in market squeezes, when there is a liquidation cascade. In both cases, those are short-lived.

Choose a deeper market

If you see a high-volume breakout on the bitcoin market, check your favorite TA indicators and decide to either buy or stay out. On BTC/fiat markets your order will fill without hurdles and you will make it safely out too when you want to, at least if you’re trading on reliable outfits and not on a tiny obscure crypto exchange.

If you see a surprise parabolic growth on a small altcoin market, remember that the chances of it catching on are next to nothing, so don’t give in to FOMO. If you buy emotionally during what traders call “pump”, there might not be enough sellers later if the market is too thin for that particular cryptocurrency. The worst case scenario is getting stuck with a bag of altcoin that slowly dies out and eventually gets delisted from the exchange.


  Don’t make excuses for being stuck with your past mistakes.


To put it in simple terms, most altcoin markets are simply not deep enough for technical daytrading. If you are okay with speculating on an incoming pump, you might be successful here and there, but that’s more similar to gambling than to trading. Technical daytrading for smaller profits is safer on big markets like BTC/fiat or ETH/fiat.

Daytrading is the technical and strategic legwork and it also means you don’t want to hold that altcoin for months of years, so don’t use that as an excuse for being stuck in your past gambles.

Choose a reliable exchange

If you are only interested in altcoins with larger markets, go for trading outfits that used to be known as “bitcoin” exchanges.


  Bitfinex trades ETH, ETC, XMR, DASH, ZEC…
  Kraken trades ETH, LTC, XRP, ZEC, XMR…


For new launches, you might find quite some on Bitfinex these days, but generally the thinner market plays concentrate on places like YoBit and BitTrex.

If you want to daytrade derivatives, your only liquid crypto futures option in 2019 is still BitMEX.

Charting

For your crypto daytrading chart analysis needs, TradingView FREE Account will be enough unless you need timespans shorter than one minute.

Summary

Daytrading in the technical sense is indeed possible on cryptocurrency markets.

It is an emotionally exhausting and time-intensive work though, therefore it is not a good fit for every crypto trader.

If you still want to give daytrading a shot, you should pay attention to the choice of markets with which you’ll engage (you might find the Wyckoff avoidance strategy useful) and to what tools and platforms you’ll be using.

Technical daytrading for smaller profits is safer on big markets like BTC/fiat or ETH/fiat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daytrading is the technical and strategic legwork and it also means you don’t want to hold that altcoin for months of years&lt;/strong&gt;, so don’t use that as an excuse for being stuck in your past gambles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;choose-a-reliable-exchange&quot;&gt;Choose a reliable exchange&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are only interested in altcoins with larger markets, go for trading outfits that used to be known as “bitcoin” exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC&quot;&gt;Bitfinex&lt;/a&gt; trades ETH, ETC, XMR, DASH, ZEC…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://kraken.com&quot;&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; trades ETH, LTC, XRP, ZEC, XMR…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For new launches, you might find quite some on &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC&quot;&gt;Bitfinex&lt;/a&gt; these days, but generally the thinner market plays concentrate on places like YoBit and BitTrex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to daytrade derivatives, your only liquid crypto futures option in 2019 is still &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2Muo11z&quot;&gt;BitMEX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;charting&quot;&gt;Charting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your crypto daytrading chart analysis needs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/atnet-tv&quot;&gt;TradingView FREE Account&lt;/a&gt; will be enough unless you need timespans shorter than one minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daytrading in the technical sense is indeed possible on cryptocurrency markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an emotionally exhausting and time-intensive work though, therefore it is not a good fit for every crypto trader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still want to give daytrading a shot, you should pay attention to the choice of markets with which you’ll engage (you might find the &lt;a href=&quot;/wyckoff-avoidance/&quot;&gt;Wyckoff avoidance strategy&lt;/a&gt; useful) and to what tools and platforms you’ll be using.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description><![CDATA[ Wyckoff method of avoidance means to trade only the best stocks in the leading sectors. How to apply this motto when trading cryptocurrencies? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Wyckoff method is getting popular in the cryptocurrency space mainly because John Bollinger the author of bbands keeps recommending it on twitter.

While it is a method that has been used heavily on legacy stock markets through a good part of the 20th century, there is no doubt it is useful for crypto as well. The versatility of the Wyckoff method lies in it being so fundamental that it is applicable in most market conditions, as far as they can be analyzed technically.

@kenzboard @MrJozza Yeah, Wyckoff is as near to a universal key to understanding trading as we have.&amp;mdash; John Bollinger (@bbands) 24 February 2017

 --- [ article continues after ad ] --- 


Wyckoff avoidance is the value trading

In simple terms, the Wyckoff avoidance method means to trade only the best assets in the leading market sectors.

Crypto is an emerging asset class, but there are already ways of determining which cryptocurrency has fundamental value. Focusing on the opportunities in those markets makes your decisions process much clearer:


  You want to buy/hold a fundamentally valuable asset when its price is not reflecting its value yet.
  You want to take profits and abandon an asset that is appreciating in the short term because of things like tiny market inefficiency or news hype.


Altcoin Trading Strategy: How strong a coin is

From StockCharts, talking about trading legacy stocks with Wyckoff avoidance method:


  The Wyckoffian mission is to trade and invest in the best stocks in the leading Industry Groups. We have been studying examples of leadership characteristics using Wyckoff Analysis in combination with relative strength [of industry assets as compared with one another]. Always be seeking the strongest stocks in the strongest groups [but also] study the asset groups that are stalling and falling from favor.


The key point is that a leader of an asset group does not stay the leader forever.

At some point the leader leaves the limelight, becomes a laggard and may stay a laggard for some time. That’s where the Wyckoff avoidance strategy brings a lot of use even for your Hodl stash and long term trades that need periodic re-evaluation. If you spot the transition of a leader to a laggard you are still left with heaps of time to gradually exit the market and decide on your next move.

Finding the market weakness

You can use any of your favorite technical analysis tools that are good for spotting the weakness of a market - divergences would be a very early sign (and possibly a misleading one) but combined with a three-push formation and lower highs when seen relative to the Bollinger bands would be more reliable.

The general technical gist is that this transition is a substantial one, you should be looking for it on longer timeframes (daily, 3D or weekly charts). The market structure will be similar in all assets in the group you are looking at, but the weakening leader would display the crumbling more strongly.

Select assets that are in harmony with the market

Another important point in Wyckoff avoidance is to select assets that move in harmony with the market. The bigger picture and relations between different assets of the same class is often overlooked, but it is incredibly useful also for market timing.

In terms of Wyckoff avoidance, the rule boils down simply to the following:


  In a bull (uptrend) market, select [assets] that are stronger than the market itself. In a bear market choose those that are weaker than the market itself.


Assuming we are in a broad crypto bull market, if you can find cryptocurrencies that are performing consistently strong and if you can also find their counterparts, you have your best candidates for your long and short positions:


  Strong cryptoassets rally quite easily. After the rally comes a retrace, but some of the gains remain.
  Weak cryptoassets don’t rally consistently. If they do, the retrace kills all the gains.


On legacy markets, it is easy to compare an asset against a composite index: In a bull market, if an asset trades still well below a known resistance line and gains more than the index, it’s typically the strong performer.

The play there is to buy this particular asset, avoiding all the rest of the assets in its group.

The technically suggested time to sell comes when the price approaches a resistance area. Then you can look which stock was performing poorly in the rally: It’s is going to be the one that should drop the most in the coming retrace and therefore it is technically the best candidate for a short.

We now also have composite indexes in cryptocurrency markets, but the information you can get from them is still fairly questionable. Remember, the crypto markets are still very new. More on crypto indexes in our Strategy article about market timing.

Going back to individual coins

To find the inceptions of changes in the market, you will have to go back to individual cryptocurrencies and look for topping patterns and reversals.

If you are a trading beginner, you can use free charting tools like Cryptowatch or TradingView, get a BTCUSD chart with Parabolic SAR, RSI and MACD indicators and go backwards to learn how past trend reversals looked. Then you can compare it with what ETHUSD was doing in that time, and then perhaps XRPUSD and smaller altcoins.

The hourly bitcoin chart below shows Parabolic SAR set to 0.025, 0.02, 0.03 on TradingView. If you click on the picture to zoom it you’ll see it flipping, and if you look at the RSI at the bottom you’ll see a divergence between the RSI lows and the price lows, which is bullish as it shows the lows are too low for the strength of the market.



When technical analysis fails

From a 2017 Financial Times article (archived link without paywall), most likely about the OKEx futures exchange:

“Daniel Masters, the founder of one of the world’s first bitcoin funds – Jersey-based Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Program (GABI) – is calling for position limits on bitcoin exchanges, after falling prey to a heinous case of cash-to-futures basis manipulation in February, when bitcoin soared to new record high.

Our position was liquidated at $767 and, needless to say, by the time we were back in the market the price was shooting back above $900. This was of course an extremely unfortunate state of affairs in which to find ourselves and a hard lesson learned. Accordingly, we lost around 10% of performance against our benchmark, the USD price of bitcoin.

The matters set out above highlighted another issue with bitcoin trading, which up until this point we had not considered. After the price drop, one player emerged as totally dominant in the open interest of the futures contract.

It seemed pretty clear to us as a result that this event was not just a normal version of a large liquidation, with which we are familiar, but was a premeditated attack. When the dust settled, one unidentified player was short well over half the open interest.

We would therefore class this episode as clear market manipulation, and in fact it was not just momentary: for many days thereafter the basis was so weak that it seemed that the one attack was being followed up by periodic smaller attacks.

As such we approached the exchange. They confirmed to us that there were no position limits whatsoever and that people were free to do whatever they wanted in their “happy trading environment” (yes, they used those actual words). We made it very clear that such activity, whether in a regulated environment or not, might amount to criminality in Hong Kong and would certainly do so in many other jurisdictions.

Following a number of discussions, the exchange encouraged the ‘rogue’ player to withdraw and things have now normalized.”

So, as a last note: Don’t be naive. Of course it’s happening.

        <title><![CDATA[ Crypto vs Forex Trading: How do they compare? ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Are you better off trading bitcoin or forex? Ultimately, it’s about picking the battles, and the right trading strategy. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ “Should I move from forex market to crypto?” This has been one of the most common questions asked by forex traders, especially since the boom of cryptocurrencies in late 2017.

The year 2017 meant a breakthrough for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Along with the wild changes in prices on the market, the business of crypto trading grew accordingly.

The years 2018 and 2019 saw the opposite move: Crypto traders bored with ranging market going nowhere started venturing into forex, oil and other legacy markets.

One thing remains though: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies moved from a niche curiosity propped by obscure online forums to the radar of everybody who invests or trades on the markets.

The Difference between Forex and Crypto Market

If you were previously fx trading, cryptocurrencies in their early stage probably weren’t attractive to you. You were used to the access to hundreds of forex pairs across majors, minors, exotics and metals. There was enough fun.

If you out of curiosity still made the decision to sample the trading of Bitcoin, other leading leading or even emerging altcoins, you must have noticed how different even the most mature among the crypto markets are from forex.

In the next section we’ll be comparing the differences, pros and cons of forex and crypto trading to help you make an informed decision on your trading future.

If instead of that you want to delve deeper into the technical analysis tools crypto traders like to use, here is a few options:


  Ichimoku Cloud: The indicator was adopted from stock market for crypto markets that don’t close for the weekends, and so Ichimoku Cloud as an indicator that works with timespans often gets used with crypto-specific settings.
  Wyckoff trading: Wyckoff method is used in stock markets rather than in forex trading because they tend to have stronger directional trends with the occasional range, and at least until this point cryptocurrencies have been similar in that. To a technical forex trader, learning about Wyckoff could be quite useful.
  Orderbook heatmaps &amp;amp; Co: On the contrary to Wyckoff, scalping in crypto will be in some way similar to the gist of fast-paced forex trading. In crypto though, we have better and more accessible advanced tools for short-term trading strategies.


Forex vs. Bitcoin and Crypto Trading

Just in case you are entirely new to the concept of cryptocurrencies, these refer to a medium of digital assets that utilize algorithms and cryptography to generate and verify transactions of value.

Some cryptoassets are used primarily as money, some primarily as technical platforms.

Nonetheless, even in 2019 the crypto market is still not evolved and stratified enough to make it reasonable to consider altcoin markets separately from bitcoin markets.

Crypto Trading: Pros and Cons


  pros



  The gains. We might as well face it that the gains some people made on the crypto markets from a tiny starting bank would be extremely unlikely to ever happen in forex. Trading cryptocurrencies has been a lucrative proposition for investors that know the right time to enter and exit the markets. However, remember that there have been just as many losses.
  The same level of leverage as in forex, except on markets with far more pronounced moves. Leveraged trading can cause a lot of damage. On the other hand, the completely free accessibility of leverage up to 100x on platforms like BitMEX that don’t even require you to state your name open up a host of possibilities. You can open straddle positions or set up risk-free collecting of swap funding payments. Remember that you need to have discipline and keep your cool though.
  Availability of lending. Staying with the previous points, the range of the possibilities depends on your location but in general you can decide to lend your crypto or fiat currencies in a more or less unregulated way. The lack of regulation also means lower costs of running business because there is less need for lawyers and insurers, and therefore the trading fees and other costs that eat from your profits are lower than on regulated markets.



  cons



  Lack of historical data. Cryptocurrency markets are very new, their valuation has been changing explosively in both directions and excluding peer-to-peer, during the first few years crypto trading was isolated to a single trading platform. For anyone trying to backtest a trading algo or just learn about typical market patterns, there is not enough historical data to use as key support and resistance levels.
  Cryptocurrencies are more volatile. Some traders like price volatility - some even trade volatility rather than price direction. But some might say that cryptocurrencies are too volatile and it’s an almighty challenge to find suitable entry and exit points.
  Strong influence of the unpredictable market sentiment. Cryptos were on an uptrend in 2017 and then they  swapped to a downtrend in 2018. This rather normal occurrence had many call the end of cryptocurrencies, not to mention the endless news about which country is trying to ban crypto again this week.


Forex Trading: Pros and Cons


  pros



  24-hour accessibility on work days. Forex traders can enjoy 24-hour access to all forex pairs with real-time pricing, charts and tools during the work week. In many ways it can be good to have a weekend, if only to plan with a clear head what to do on  market open.
  Market leverage. Forex has been known for tight ranges and therefore the widespread use of leverage to maximize trading profits. Common forex leverages are up to 100x, depending on your broker.
  Unrivaled liquidity. The forex market is undoubtedly the most liquid market in financial trading; it is the easiest market to open and close positions with speed.



  cons



  Forex is not ideal for smaller trading banks. In truth, the forex market is largely made up of hedge funds and trading groups. Given the small percentage moves on forex pairs, you need a sizable trading bank to generate respectable returns.
  Unpredictable volatility. Forex markets are called “legacy” which implies something stable, but they can be just as volatile as cryptocurrency markets. Indeed there are moments of extreme volatility in forex, particularly surrounding political events.


Comparing the Opportunities on Forex and Crypto Markets

In truth, there is a place for crypto and forex trading in all our trading arsenals. Do not expect to come from forex markets, apply your usual forex trading strategy in crypto, walk away with millions after a week and retire early.

Crypto markets are different from forex markets, even though cryptos are also currencies.

On the other hand, non-directional strategies that minimize your risk are available far more easily and at less costs on the crypto markets - it is just human nature that this lack of constraints also attracts foolish risking.

Ultimately, it’s about picking the right battles and knowing the right time to use them when the risk factors are on your side.

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;“Should I move from forex market to crypto?” This has been one of the most common questions asked by forex traders, especially since the boom of cryptocurrencies in late 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year 2017 meant a breakthrough for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Along with the wild changes in prices on the market, the business of crypto trading grew accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The years 2018 and 2019 saw the opposite move: Crypto traders bored with ranging market going nowhere started venturing into forex, oil and other legacy markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing remains though: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies moved from a niche curiosity propped by obscure online forums to the radar of everybody who invests or trades on the markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home.saxo/en-gb/products/forex&quot;&gt;fx trading&lt;/a&gt;, cryptocurrencies in their early stage probably weren’t attractive to you. You were used to the access to hundreds of forex pairs across majors, minors, exotics and metals. There was enough fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you out of curiosity still made the decision to sample the trading of Bitcoin, other leading leading or even emerging altcoins, you must have noticed how different even the most mature among the crypto markets are from forex.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Crypto Wallets by Use Case ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Arguably the core of 'be your own bank' principle - How did crypto wallets evolve and what are the features you're looking for, as a trader? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ What would we do without crypto wallets? They keep our coins safe and untouchable, without them holding cryptocurrencies wouldn’t make sense.

Since the inception of Bitcoin, wallets have always been an integral part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.



How else would you be your own bank?

People who are only in crypto for the investment might be blind to it, but the following is a simple fact: Should we be interested in such a thing, crypto wallets can be our own personal banks.

Nonetheless, it’s 2019. There are banks that store crypto for their clients - providing cryptocurrency custody service for them, and to most of their clients it will seem that the concept of personal storage is somewhat unnecessary. After all, it is like in every line of commerce: Someone charges a fee for making a complex thing simple to handle.

You know what they say though - Not your keys, not your coin. Letting someone else take care of your cryptocurrency introduces the element of trust into crypto, and if this were sensible, we wouldn’t have cryptocurrencies at all because everyone would be perfectly happy with fiat.

Good news is that just like cryptocurrency custody providers make “having” crypto easier, crypto wallet developers are likewise making it easier to manage your coins yourself. That reaches from simplistic usability for the wallet you use every day from your phone to advanced anonymizing tools for coins that are not inherently private.

In short, there are now so many different types of crypto wallets - wallets that each can serve a specific role in our trading journey.

The evolution of crypto wallets

Crypto wallets have evolved a lot throughout the years and they have become safer, more flexible, and more personalized.

All the crypto wallet drainage: The human factor

One early type of crypto wallets were so-called brainwallets.

These days, when you’re setting up a new wallet via its software, you get a random 12-24 seed phrase generated for you. Essentially, you could have a brain wallet do the same thing - but you would have to come up with that seed yourself. Most people would instead have their brainwallet generated from a simple phrase - the name brainwallet refers to the concept of memorizing your seed rather than writing it down on a piece of paper. Once this became a known fact, there was a wave of bruteforce attacks.

By now, probably all of these primitive brainwallets have been drained by hackers. They are one of the reasons why people who weren’t in crypto would be convinced that “crypto always gets stolen”, or some other similar blanket statement. Today’s crypto wallet landscape is far safer though, simply because it doesn’t leave the crucial task of seed generation to humans.

Crypto wallets by their purpose

There are a couple different kinds of crypto wallets out there:

Paper wallet - For this kind of wallet, your private keys and public addresses are printed on a piece of paper. If you can physically manage the paper, this will be your safest storage option that doesn’t even require a lot of technical skill. It is not feasible to use a paper wallet for daily transactions though.

Hardware wallet - These wallets are actual physical devices that are built specifically for handling private keys and public addresses. It’s probably the most secure kind of crypto wallet for the regular crypto investor who is not skilled to homelab their own air-gapped crypto storage. For now, crypto hardware wallet producers still do not care too much about the sourcing of the hardware, and even if they did, us traders would still only need to take their word for it.

Software bugs and vulnerabilities in hardware wallets get discovered several times each year but generally, the criminal activity in crypto stealing focuses on much far lower hanging fruit. That makes hardware wallets very reasonable safe. Hardware wallets are usable enough for regular transactions, although not extremely convenient.

Desktop wallets - These are wallets that you can download via software packs. There are tons of these available for all operating systems - Mac, Windows, Linux, etc. They are very easy to use, but exposed to every piece of malicious or spying code that your laptop might contract from adverts or videos during common web browsing.

Mobile wallets - These are applications that people can download on their smartphones. They are ideal for smaller transactions on-the-go, or as a transit place for an exchange withdrawal which will eventually go to a hardware wallet.

If you are a trader, a combination of a mobile app wallet and a hardware wallet is currently the best compromise for both usability and security.

Web wallets - The least secure way of storing crypto. You can use web browsers to access these wallets, and in some cases you do not even get to own your private keys. Having your crypto in a web wallet that keeps your private key is equivalent to leaving the coin on an exchange.


  In crypto, security should always be your top priority.


When it comes to cryptocurrency trading, you should always really, really, really think twice before leaving your money on an exchange just because you’re too lazy to withdraw them.

Just pick a mobile wallet and a hardware wallet and if it’s only slightly doable for you, transact from devices that you don’t use on a daily basis to limit your exposure to malware.

The next thing would be to always consider how secure your wallet (still) is and how you can even make it more secure. After all, these are the things that hold all our money.

These are the questions to ask yourself:


  Is the development and testing active?
  Is there a community on Reddit or elsewhere around the wallet?
  Crypto wallets are a black box, unless you’re a security researcher: Who are the devs? Do they have any reputation at all? How long have they been around?


Of course, always be sure to enable all security measures like setting a strong password and enabling 2-Factor Authentication.

Good wallets on the market?

There are tons of different wallets to explore out there but I’ve rounded up three wallets that seem to be the best at what kind of wallet they are.

Trezor

Trezor is probably the most user-friendly hardware wallet around, even though in terms of popularity it loses to Ledger. Trezor works with multiple currencies and also works as a password manager as well as a two-factor authentication device. The device has a failsafe for lost passwords and lost devices (but you should probably still be extra careful that this does not happen).

Electrum

One of the oldest and most highly regarded desktop wallets, Electrum is available for download on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Android. It has the ability to work with some physical wallets and offers a great deal of flexibility.

Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin wallet where the lightweight means you don’t need to download the whole blockchain - Electrum has its own network of trusted nodes. That is a convenience but also a limitation, as the Electrum node network was under a severe DDoS attack through April 2019.

Blockchain.com

Formerly Blockchain.info, this is one of the more secure crypto wallet services that are accessible through a web browser. It currently supports BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC and XLM only and comes with a pretty convenient smartphone app. The app has a bunch of advanced security features that you won’t find in more popular wallet apps - think IP whitelisting, fingerprint access and such. They’ll nag you about verifying your real world identity though, so you will have to proceed with caution if privacy is important to you.

Where now?


  If you’re looking to buy a commercial hardware wallet, there are discount offers throughout the year. We keep the good ones listed here.

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions to ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the development and testing active?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is there a community on Reddit or elsewhere around the wallet?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crypto wallets are a black box, unless you’re a security researcher: Who are the devs? Do they have any reputation at all? How long have they been around?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, always be sure to enable all security measures like setting a strong password and enabling 2-Factor Authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;good-wallets-on-the-market&quot;&gt;Good wallets on the market?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of different wallets to explore out there but I’ve rounded up three wallets that seem to be the best at what kind of wallet they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trezor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trezor is probably the most user-friendly hardware wallet around, even though in terms of popularity it loses to Ledger. Trezor works with multiple currencies and also works as a password manager as well as a two-factor authentication device. The device has a failsafe for lost passwords and lost devices (but you should probably still be extra careful that this does not happen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest and most highly regarded desktop wallets, Electrum is available for download on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Android. It has the ability to work with some physical wallets and offers a great deal of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin wallet where the lightweight means you don’t need to download the whole blockchain - Electrum has its own network of trusted nodes. That is a convenience but also a limitation, as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/altcointrading_/status/1123080686288740352&quot;&gt;Electrum node network was under a severe DDoS attack through April 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockchain.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formerly Blockchain.info, this is one of the more secure crypto wallet services that are accessible through a web browser. It currently supports BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC and XLM only and comes with a pretty convenient smartphone app. The app has a bunch of advanced security features that you won’t find in more popular wallet apps - think IP whitelisting, fingerprint access and such. They’ll nag you about verifying your real world identity though, so you will have to proceed with caution if privacy is important to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-now&quot;&gt;Where now?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re looking to buy a commercial hardware wallet, there are discount offers throughout the year. We keep the good ones listed &lt;a href=&quot;/blackfriday/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ The fundamental value of a cryptocurrency is not declared by any authority, it derives from how they are used.

As the blockchain space grows though, frameworks have been developed to categorize types of cryptoassets. Even though a clear enough framework is still not in place and so the regulatory issues are probably going to stick around for a bit longer, using the classification that is already available can still help you decide whether you actually want to enter that market or not.

Types of altcoins

In 2016, when the first alt season started, the community liked to focus on differences in technology.

Namely, which technology is the most novel, disruptive or revolutionary.  Ethereum came about like this, prior to ETH there was no asset to act as a fuel for decentralized apps.

By 2018, we had hundreds of (somewhat) active cryptocurrency projects, each sporting an interesting technology tweak, but none having much practical use - perhaps with the exception of decentralized gaming.

The relative success of dApp games indicated the focus shift from the tech onto how is the tech used.

This is where we still are today: The underlying technology is secondary; it may be the best known way to implement the function of the cryptocurrency but the function is decided first.

Crypto-Money

Cryptocurrencies as means of payment

Some altcoins were developed as means of payment, in the same sense as Bitcoin was developed as means of payment.

A cryptocurrency developed as crypto-money addresses certain weaknesses of the conventional payment system.

One such issue is the inability to exchange money freely, even if it’s to an entity located in a far-away country that maybe doesn’t like your country’s president or religion.

This problem can also occur internally within a single country, in an attempt of total control over how individuals spend: Here is a comment from 2018, where an upper middle class person in Argentina received an accusation in tax fraud because the revenue office does not believe she does not have a hired house cleaner. In the context of Argentina, the idea was probably to keep people from getting rid of the national currency which was on the brink of collapse at that time.

Bitcoin can address most of the payment-related issues in the fiat world.

Alternative cryptocurrencies developed for payments typically attempt, in turn, to solve one of the “weaknesses” of Bitcoin:


  Implementing full privacy to advance the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin (XMR)
  Focusing on scaling and transaction throughput (BCH, EOS, XRP)
  Lowering the energy consumptions of mining (PoS coins)
  Making transactions faster and cheap or even free (LTC, IOT)


Realistically, pseudonymous transactions and the transaction fee are only a problem for a subset of your normal everyday financial transactions.

Clearly XMR and full-privacy cryptocurrencies are a niche case. It is also not unreasonable to expect that BTC will be used for larger transactions, such as buying a house with Bitcoin, while tiny transactions would run on an alternative blockchain, such as ones between IoT devices.

The value of payment-focused cryptocurrencies derives from the strength of the network - traders follow metrics like network activity, number of ATMs, the size of the OTC market, payment implementations.

Interesting Crypto-Money altcoins:


  Monero


Monero is scalable and mined in a decentralized fashion because XMR mining is done via GPU which limits the usage of ASICs (application-specific circuits).

Monero payments are unlinkable, untraceable, fully anonymous and mineable on any device with a little bit of redundant computational power. That makes XMR the preferred cryptocurrency for cryptojacking, the easiest way to monetize illicit access into someone else’s device or sever.


  DASH


Dash is short for digital cash. The pivotal properties of DASH are anonymous blockchain and masternode system. The privacy system is less bulletproof than the one of Monero but the implementation of payment gateways is more widespread because implementing DASH requires less work than implementing Monero.


  Litecoin


LTC used to be the second most popular altcoin before cryptocurrencies like ETH and XRP emerged. It was created to handle massive transaction volumes but so far, it was mostly used as a guinea pig for Bitcoin blockchain innovations due to the similarity of the two. Along with DOGE, it has been since its inception used by traders to move money between exchanges for less fees.

Crypto-Fuel

Cryptocurrencies as dApp tokens

Some altcoins were developed as communication tokens: Whoever wants to engage with a decentralized app (dApp) needs to use an appropriate token to do that.

While that is still the case, on the part of the user it does not need to involve holding dozens of separate tokens since we have projects like Kyber Network that can do atomic token swaps between different tokenized assets.

Crypto tokens are still publicly traded and used for speculation.

Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, never endorsed ETH as a storage value. Why are these tokens speculated so much then? The Internet will point you to the Blue ocean Strategy.

When ETH first emerged, traders argued that crypto-fuel tokens were downplaying the monetary value of the coin on purpose: To show that it is not just another “better money”. Tokens are a new category, one that first came to existence with blockchain, and demand for this type of asset was quickly created.

The value of crypto-fuel tokens is expected to surge with the demand, but ideally with an actual (non-speculative) demand. The non-speculative demand is still awaited to arrive one day in the future though.

Interesting Crypto-Fuel altcoins:


  Ether, ERC-20 fungible tokens


Ethereum is the original blockchain for the execution of complicated smart contracts. (Simple smart contracts like an escrow can run on the Bitcoin blockchain as well.)

At first, ETH was deemed the scalable cryptocurrency with fast and cheap transactions. This view was quickly shattered when gaming dApps became popular and started flooding the blockchain with data. Then came the ICO bubble, likewise showing how easy it is to make Ethereum transactions slow and expensive.

We have since got a new generation of app-platform cryptocurrencies that focus on scalability (EOS, ZIL) and we also got the sidechain implementation which allows for existence of decentralized cryptoasset exchanges and blockchain games that do not spam the network and are free to use.

A quick note about investing into tokens: Large amount of people hold Ethereum or tokens for investment. There in infinite amount of Ether to be mined but the inflation is kept low. Some argue that after the switch to PoS the monetary value of ETH could stabilize and make a good store of value.

Crypto-Vouchers

Cryptoassets that can be exchanged for another predefined asset

Stablecoins belong to this category: They are assets living on blockchain that have a value redeemable in another asset, like IOUs.

There can be IOUs for other assets than money, though. A cryptocurrency can also be a tokenized access to service or an ecommerce gift card.

Security Tokens

The concept of utility vs security token is still new.

It is a regulatory term used for tokens that represent an investment in entrepreneurial efforts of someone else, much like investing in stocks. This type of tokens is becoming regulated because they resemble stocks, an already regulated asset.

In the concept of a “decentralized organization”, anyone can become a “shareholder” by buying a token. The work of the organization is then focused on revenue generation in whatever the company decides to call their profit unit.

The monetary value of the token changes based on the organization’s revenues.


  BitShares, DAO


BitShares was the first platform coming up with the concept of decentralized organization.

The idea later became infamous with the fall of DAO, which was hacked but the consequences of the hack were mitigated by the ETH hard fork that produced ETC.

Shitcoins

The last category of alternative cryptocurrencies are shitcoins.

It should be noted that some people will want to call perhaps EOS or Tezos a shitcoin, but they do not fall into this category.

Legitimate shitcoins are not a product of a cryptoasset project that somehow failed or disappointed, shitcoins are the cryptoassets that never had any value proposition in the first place.

We do see less of them now in the blockchain space. It is a now forgotten part of history but in 2016, the golden era of Poloniex, we did have coins that were seriously only created as an ego-blast of someone who could afford to pay the programmer. Max Keiser had his own coin, MaxCoin.

If you checked a shitcoin’s website, you would see random strings of meaningless buzzwords, such as


  Vcash was engineered to be innovative and forward-thinking. It prevents eavesdropping and censorship, promotes decentralized, energy efficient and instant network transactions. (- Taken from now defunct vanillacoin.net)


The value of shitcoins was always purely speculative. They might pump and you might be coming early enough to cash in but that’s it.

The 2017 edition of the shitcoin mania was the end of the ICO bubble - fake token sales with barely a landing page, fake LinkedIn profiles with fake names of fake team members, no plans to ever develop anything.

The actual people behind the scams would collect the crowdfunding and vanish, and like with every bubble there were some brave traders who earned good money flipping tokens of proven scams on the greater fool.

Starting from 2018 we see less of this activity - not because of regulation, but because of how crowded the gravy train of token offerings has gotten.

It is increasingly difficult to stand out just like it is increasingly difficult to pump and dump maturing cryptocurrencies.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ The feature of today’s Script Spotlight is an older tool that is not groundbreaking or super sophisticated but it will make your chart reading faster.

It is called The Detrended Price Oscillator and it is very similar to a simple moving average.

If you care for high leveraged trading, you’re probably looking for BitMEX as well, keep your cool though.

Detrended Price Oscillator Strategy by HPotter

study(title=&quot;Detrended Price Oscillator&quot;, shorttitle=&quot;DPO&quot;)
Length = input(14, minval=1)
Series = input(title=&quot;Price&quot;, type=string, defval=&quot;close&quot;)
hline(0, color=green, linestyle=line)
xPrice = close
xsma = sma(xPrice, Length)
nRes = xPrice - xsma
pos = iff(nRes &amp;gt; 0, 1,
	     iff(nRes &amp;lt; 0, -1, nz(pos[1], 0)))
barcolor(pos == -1 ? red: pos == 1 ? green : blue )
plot(nRes, color=red, title=&quot;Detrended Price Oscillator&quot;)


Parameters: Length (number of timespans to calculate over, default 14) and Price (candle value input, default Close).

What it does: It takes the price values over the chosen span and calculates a standard moving average from them. It then calculates the difference between the price and the SMA: nRes = xPrice - xsma

The resulting line gets plotted below the chart and the chart’s candles are colored red or green depending on whether the value of the difference is positive or negative.

This is what the Detrended Price Oscillator, or DPO, looks like on a 1D BTCUSD chart. (I changed the default colors for clarity)

barcolor(pos == -1 ? orange: pos == 1 ? lime : aqua )



Does it work?

Of course it does work, there’s no rocket science in this one. You can use it on any timeframe and play with the length of the span.

On the 1W DPO gives an easy single-glance information about the market:



Even better, it is worth noting that the information you get from the color changes is equivalent to the cross of the Bollinger Band middle line on Bollinger Bands of the same length.

Here on a 1W chart for the lengths of 28:



For very long-term crypto charts this is actually more convenient that the bbands, if you are only looking for the position of the price relative to the mean.

You’ll notice I had to switch off the auto sizing on the chart because due to the periods of cryptocurrency bubbles, the lower and upper Bollinger bands shoot too far.

It won’t be a very difficult job to add candle coloring for the lower and upper Bollinger band crosses either, by the way.

Bottom Line

The Detrended Price Oscillator is indeed similar to SMAs. The information is presented by coloring the chart candles though, which means you don’t have to squint your eyes at the chart when investigating trend cycles.

A marginal advantage but if you have a chart with no candle-coloring script in place, this would be a good choice.

        <title><![CDATA[ Why Are So Many People Trading Cryptocurrency? ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ The crypto trading statistics from Google Trends show a new wave of interest in trading of digital currencies. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Cryptocurrencies might be new, but they’ve shown great potential to change our world’s future.

It’s a disruptive technology that promises outstanding returns. The small investments you put into cryptocurrency can grow into life-changing profits over a couple of years. This is the main reason why you should be interested in trading cryptocurrency.



Google Trends organic stats for “crypto trading” in US / 2019

The success of trading cryptocurrencies can only be possible if you’ve done your research and developed a good trading strategy. You should also be wise if you find some great tips on cryptocurrency trading from the internet before you start trading.

Nevertheless, do work on your good practice and don’t forget to double-check even the information shared in the following trading tips.

Here are a few reasons that we think are the major driving forces behind the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency trading.

Cryptocurrency Markets Have Higher Volatility

Volatility means the variation of the trading prices over a certain period of time. The majority of stocks in the stock market have much less volatility than cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies went through a lot of volatility because of short-term speculative interest from investors. One good example of such volatility was seen from October 2017 to October 2018, where Bitcoin’s value rose as high as $19,378 and fell down to $5,851.

The higher the volatility is, the riskier it’ll be. But this is what makes cryptocurrencies exciting and trending. Because of cryptocurrency’s high volatility, you have the chance to earn more than half of your initial investment in just a couple of days when you start trading.

The prices of cryptocurrencies are changing every minute. The rapid variations of these prices provide a lot of opportunities for traders to either go long or short when trading. This is even better for short-term swing traders or day traders because cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, tend to move from 5%-10% in just a day.

Yes, the risks are high, but if you’ve done your research and understand how to trade cryptocurrencies, you won’t mind them at all because you’re looking at the bigger picture, which is great profits.

The Volatility Of Cryptocurrencies Makes For More Trading Opportunities

This is really one of the controversial reasons why many people are trading cryptocurrency since not everyone has managed to do it successfully. There are plenty of stories around the internet about how people ploughed their entire life savings into cryptocurrencies only to lose it all.

But this will only happen if you dove into cryptocurrencies without doing your research and coming up with a good strategy. You need to be smart and cautious when trading cryptocurrencies so you can earn more money from your initial investment.

If you do it the right way, you get the chance to double or maybe even triple your earnings when you start trading cryptocurrencies. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies will make it possible for you to buy a digital currency at a low price today and sell it when its value soars up again after a couple of days.

Cryptocurrency Markets Are Available 24/7

Stock markets only open on weekdays and for a couple of hours a day. Cryptocurrency markets, on the other hand, are available 24/7 and you can access them anywhere in the world.

This is perfect for traders who have a daytime job. You can trade cryptocurrencies after going home from work or you can do it during the weekends. It’s hard for a trader with a daytime job to be active on the stock market since it only opens when most people are at work.

You can trade cryptocurrency anytime and anywhere because its market has decentralized governance. This means that it doesn’t have a single regulatory board that oversees and manages it.

This means that you don’t need to follow or comply to a schedule to make a trade since you can do it anytime of the day, making it more convenient than trading in the stock market.

No Trading Limit or “Pattern Day Trading Rule”

The pattern day trading rule is a law that prohibits you to do more than 3-day trades in 5 business days if you have less than $25,000 in your account in stock markets. This is a bit of a bummer for traders who likes to get the most out of their investments since it limits their trading activities.

But there’s no such rule observed when trading cryptocurrencies. Even if you only have $200 in your account, you can trade as many cryptocurrencies as you want every day. What this means is that if you’ve developed a strategy to trade cryptocurrencies successfully, you’ll have the potential to grow your $200 much faster than trading in stock markets.

Algo and Tech Equipment Is Not Needed

Another reason why many people are trading cryptocurrency is because of the convenience it provides. You don’t need a supercomputer with 4 monitors to start trading cryptocurrencies. You can trade crypto straight from your mobile phone.

There are many cryptocurrency exchanges or platforms out there that have a great mobile app with plenty of features and executions, which makes trading from your mobile device much easier.

The best exchange mobile apps are built around API access. That means you can for instance only allow lending in your phone app, but not trading or withdrawals. Apps built like that offer a very good level of security.

Conclusion

In today’s job market where wages get stagnant and finding a job becomes really hard, the vast majority of people would very much welcome an extra source of income. It can help take off some pressure from your bills that are piling up or treat yourself to a nice vacation - that is the main motivation behind the bulk of retail interest in trading crypto.

However, if you’re not careful when trading cryptocurrency, you may find yourself in a rough spot and eventually lose all of your investment.

Cryptocurrency trading is not a game. There’s real money for you to earn but there’s also real money for you to lose.

Do your research to improve your understanding of how the cryptocurrency market works so you can avoid the pitfalls of trading cryptocurrency.

Most people who are trading cryptocurrency are in it for the money. If done properly, it’s indeed a great way of making big money. Just be aware of the risks beforehand and always stick to a reasonable strategy.

        <description><![CDATA[ Divergence is a disagreement between price and an oscillating indicator such as MACD or RSI. It is not strong enough an indicator to enter a position, but it gives an idea of the state of the market. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ What are divergences in trading?

When traders talk about divergences, or divs, they are pointing out a disagreement between the price action and a technical indicator. The thing to look for in the price development are highs and lows, pick a pair of prominent ones and check if your indicator rendered the opposite thing: price made higher high, look for lower high in the indicator for that timespan.

The indicator of choice is typically some kind of oscillator (RSI, MACD).

These divergences signify prevailing momentum in the market. Depending on the type of the divergence they suggest either continuation or reversal.

Divergences in short

We distinguish regular divergence, hidden divergence and exaggerated divergence.

Regular Divergence is a sign of trend reversal. Price keeps the trend but indicator already shows the reversal.


  Signal to short = regular divergence in tops. Price makes higher high but oscillator makes lower high. Underlying weakness, possible exhaustion at the end of a bull trend.
  Signal to long = regular divergence in bottoms. Price makes lower low but oscillator makes higher low. Underlying strength, possible bottoming in progress.


Hidden Divergence is a divergence that follows the trend. Hidden divs show the market is inclined to continue the current trend.


  Signal to short = hidden divergence in tops. Price makes lower highs but oscillator makes higher highs. Tends to be found on lower highs in a downtrend.
  Signal to long = hidden divergence in bottoms. Price makes higher low but oscillator makes lower low. Tends to be found during continuation pauses in an uptrend.


Exaggerated Divergence is only different in that price makes double top or double bottom rather than new high or new low.



Divergences only show a level where to wait for entry signal

The logic behind divergences is that sometimes the indicators shows hidden tendencies of the market (strength or weakness) that might not be visible from the price action yet.

However, this is not a sharp enough indication to signal the actual entry. It gives the idea about the direction you should be looking for when looking for an entry on that timeframe but you will need to dig deeper and switch to shorter timeframes to find a plausible place for your entry.

Examples of MACD divergence, RSI divergence and %bb divergence

Price vs MACD Divergence, standard settings

This is a regular bullish divergence on an old ETHUSD chart.



Price vs StochRSI Divergence

This is a 1D chart of BTCUSD, Bitfinex. The StochRSI shows hidden bearish divergence, the momentum is set to continue the bearish trend.



Price vs %b Divergence, BBands 21 periods - stdev 3

Divergence with %b is a more precise way to observe whether new extremes of the price action are closer to or farther from the bollinger band’s boundaries. There is a more reliable version of the double bottom formation on the bbands: price makes a new low but that now is not a new low relatively to the bbands. That is to say, the first low is below the lower bband and the second low is a lower low in absolute terms (the price) but also either on or above the lower bband - video on bbands explaining that in this article.

TradingView provides the %b indicator which measures how far is the price from the bollinger band of your selected standard deviation and it plots this distance. The situation where you have new low in price but not a new low relatively to the bands shows as a regular bullish divergence on %b.

This is a 2H chart of BTCUSD, Bitfinex - the same period as the previous one on 1D. Having bearish divergences on a longer timeframe and a bullish divergence on a shorter one shows a short recovery might be in the cards but the bulls aren’t winning yet.

        <description><![CDATA[ Lo and behold, there is a strategy even to hodling. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ It’s not only that crypto trading is not for everyone. The truth is that sometimes there is just not a good opportunity to trade: Too choppy, too aggressive stop hunts, volume too thin.

So, how can you turn a profit on your crypto when you don’t want to trade with your holdings?

Build a ‘hodl’ strategy

This is the simplest method ever. The basis of it is simply to decide whether you think a cryptocurrency is worth keeping for the long run, and hold it in your wallet.

With only a little more effort in your crypto holding strategy, you can make the actual profit taking much simpler for yourself:


  First, look for good fundamentals like network effect, resistance to bad news, a use case showing that it’s more than a vaporware.
  Once you find cryptocurrencies you want to keep, decide on how long you are willing to hold them. Ballpark is good enough: A decade? A year?
  Next, split that period and make a mental note on how often you will re-evaluate your investment. You could go with seasonal cycles - 6 months, 1 year, or a halving cycle.
  Every time your point of re-evaluation comes, you can decide to rebalance and take out your principal amount from the profits, or to just keep holding.


Lending your crypto

If you have significant amount of Bitcoins (or Ether, or any other cryptocurrency that is traded on an exchange) you can lend it to crypto traders and other people who will pay you interest.

There is a range of lending platforms where you can do this. There are places like Ethlend where you can lend a range of some 250 ERC-20 tokens. You can also go for margin and swap funding options for major coins via exchanges like Bitfinex, Bitmex, Poloniex etc.

For the lazy people who do not want to manually manage the lending stuff, a crypto lending bot can take care of it either for free or for a small fee.

The costs depend on whether you will go for an open-source code from Github that you will have to set up and configure yourself, or if you will go the easier way of a commercial product.

Running a Masternode

A masternode is simply a cryptocurrency full node with a wallet that keeps the full copy of the blockchain in real time. By that it supports the coin’s network by hosting a full copy of the ledger.

A masternode must be always up and running and is required to perform certain special tasks in various cryptocurrencies. You as the masternode owner get compensated for your masternode doing these tasks.

Keep in mind that most projects have different amount of coins to be held in the node wallet as a minimum to start running your node as a masternode.

Also, the requirement of being up and running 24/7 might be a bit discouraging.

Staking

Staking might be the easiest way to get some extra income on some of the cryptocurrencies you hold.

It is in fact less work than holding, because it requires no strategy or evaluation - as long as you are primarily collecting more of a coin.

In order to be able to start staking, your selected coins have to follow the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism (this is the only way for stakers to be rewarded and the blockchain to be secured at the same time).

If you own the proof-of-stake coins, you just keep them in a staking wallet to generate new coins. No effort included, no minimum limit on how much of the coin you have to hold to be able to stake.

You can earn some 10% extra coins in a year by just holding and staking them. It is like a regular dividend or profit on your cryptocurrencies.

Mining and other early opportunities: Bounties, Rebates, Cashback…

Mining of the most popular proof-of-work coins (like Bitcoin) is a by and large a lost case unless you are in special circumstances. These days, mining is only really profitable if you are a big player, but if you have cheap electricity and a decent gaming PC you still can make a small profit on it.

However, the entry barriers are serious, so mining is usually limited to mining farms and professionals. There are also some cloud mining services but when you look into their terms of use you will quickly notice you will not make a single penny on it.

If you have mining rigs and cooling stuff left over from when small scale Bitcoin mining still paid, you can still turn some profit with that on the altcoin markets. There are new proof-of-work cryptocurrencies still being launched where you can get in early. On AltcoinTrading.NET, you can sometimes find out about these new coins if you browse the Crypto Airdrops section.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is an indicator that looks complex to traders with 5 seconds attention spans.

Once you know what it does, it makes your crypto trading decisions way faster though.

Mastering Ichimoku Cloud trading really brings you one step closer to the actually realistic goal of crypto trading:

Making high-probability decisions without spending your whole day watching your TradingView charts.

Ichimoku Cloud Definition


  Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates as “one look equilibrium chart”. It was designed specifically to enable quicker and easier decision making when it comes to the strength of a market.


Ichimoku cloud is one of the default indicators available on TradingView even with the free plan.

If you want to learn about the more advanced TradingView scripts available on free plan, we are reviewing them here: Tradingview Script Spotlight

Ichimoku Cloud Lines Explained

The Senkou and The Kumo

“Senkou span” is the name for the borders of the filled cloud, or “Kumo cloud”. The span is filled with green color in case the market is bullish. It will turn red in bearish markets, when the two spans swap.

Senkou lines are major support/resistance areas - they attract the price. Traders set their entries, exits and stops around them - usually leveraging additional information from other indicators.

The TK lines and The TK Cross

The “TK lines”, or Tenken and Kinjun, are the balance lines - fast and slow moving averages.

They are moving averages, so traders will look for their cross when they are looking for a trend reversal. Because of their names, this cross is called “TK cross”.

Nonetheless, TK lines are also important when there is no cross in sight. If the price sticks around them, it signals that the asset is neither overhyped nor underpriced. If the price action travels very far from the TK lines, it signifies the price is way out of balance and a pullback is likely, but it is by itself not a trigger to open a position for the pullback.

In more balanced markets the price stays around these lines and traders watch how it is bouncing off them or crossing them when they are looking for a good entry.

The Chinkou

The “Chinkou” span is a lagging indicator, use it to confirm a trend strength. Chinkou line above the candles means the market is strong. If the Chinkou crossed below candles, it’s a bearish turn:



When there is a strong action and the lagging line crosses the candles it is a sign the trend is weakening and becoming undecided. Reversal is likely, but again, this by itself is not yet a trigger to short:



How to read Ichimoku Cloud

BASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bullish signals

For a strong bullish signal, everything must occur above the Kumo cloud: The price action must remain above the Kumo cloud. The Chinkou line must stay above the kumo and Tenken should be crossing Kinjun also above the Kumo. Tenken should be crossing upside - if this cross occurs inside of the Kumo that’s still weakly bullish.

BASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bearish signals

If you are looking for strong bearish signal, with Ichimoku cloud you can pretty much reverse all that has been said to bullish signals - price action occurs below Kumo, as well as Tenken and Kinjun crossing and the lagging line Chinkou. Basically the more happens below the stronger the bears are.

BASICS: None of this?

If none of this is happening then it most likely means that at your timeframe the market is undecided, sideways, waiting for direction.

Market Structures suitable for Ichimoku Cloud

Ichimoku is mostly useful in trending markets.

You won’t get much information from Ichimoku Cloud in ranging markets. In market ranges, the cloud will be swapping between red and green very often, yielding very little actionable information. The same happens on short timeframes - and there are much better indicators and strategies if you want to be scalping crypto.


  To trade market ranges, it is more sensible to use the Wyckoff analysis or any oscillating indicators, possibly also with regard to divergences.


Ichimoku Cloud strategies with other TA indicators

There is a number of trading strategies that involve Ichimoku. Involve - that’s right. Even in trending cryptocurrency markets, Ichimoku Cloud is rarely used alone. Typically, traders will use it combined with other indicators.

Typically, these indicators will provide some way of identifying your support-resistance levels based on volume. It makes sense to use a volume-based indicator with Ichimoku because the cloud is only rendered from price action cycles and disregards volume completely.

Popular Crypto Trading Indicators to use with Ichimoku


  Volume, either in the standard way or as volume colored candles available from TradingView
  StochRSI or other momentum oscillators
  Fibs as an alternative way to find your most probable reversal areas
  Bollinger Bands as a way to provide some range-like bounds even if the market is trending rather than ranging


Here is a good presentation of how to use Ichimoku cloud with fractals and high-volume support and resistance levels by ChaosTrader on YouTube.

Additional Ichimoku strategies are linked at the bottom of the article.



Ichimoku Cloud Crypto Settings

Last but not least, the controversial bit:

Should you use alternative settings for Ichimoku Cloud on cryptocurrency markets?


  Ichimoku cloud uses past action of the market to predict most probable price direction in the near future.
  The cloud is rendered from simplified past moving averages calculated from past highs and lows.
  Because Ichimoku cloud takes the past action to predict the most likely future ranges and breaking points, traders want to reflect the past market action as precisely as possible.




Ichimoku works with timely moving averages, so on the crypto markets it follows reason to set meaningful timespans considering the fact that crypto trades 24/7/365.

The traditional Ichimoku cloud settings (9, 26, 52, 26):


  9 represents a week and a half of trading
  26 equals the number of trading days in a typical month (30 minus four Sundays)
  52 equals two months of trading days


The idea of special Ichimoku cloud settings for cryptocurrencies is that the market is open 24/7 (20, 30, 120, 60):


  7+3.5 = 10 (because of low volume on Sunday), or double for longer term trend capture
  30 days in a month
  2 trading months in crypto = 60 days



  
    
      Parameter
      Value
    
  
  
    
      Conversion line period

      Base line period

      Lagging span 2 periods
      120
    
    
      Displacement
      60
    
  


Some traders reject this alternative Ichimoku cloud crypto settings.

Their reasoning is that the period lengths are meant to capture a time period, it doesn’t matter whether it falls into a week or not and changing the defaults is wrong. That is different from what StockCharts article about Ichimoku says and it seems a bit ignorant to disregard movements influenced by the day of the week.

It is true that if big enough traders start to use the default settings, it will become valuable to use what they are using.

Unless you are prone to analysis-paralysis, it will not hurt to check both settings. Always backtest your indicator settings to see if it is sensible according to recent market behavior.



Ichimoku Cloud Traders and Tutorials

Below is a collection of the best that’s out there to read and watch when you’re looking to develop a Ichimoku cloud trading system for your cryptocurrency speculations.

CarpeNoctom (crypto, basic Ichimoku trading strategies)

CarpeNoctom made a basic video intro into Ichimoku Cloud that explains everything about the indicator pretty well. If you are new in trading, you should definitely watch it before you move onto the more fun but also more advanced stuff further down below.






ChaosTrader63 (Mostly legacy, but advanced Ichimoku trading strategies)

The legacy trader ChaosTrader63 has a YouTube channel and Twitter dedicated mainly to Ichimoku cloud. He mainly provides price commentary with new videos about once a week, and his trades are focused more on the long term. You will see him use the 1D chart a lot, explaining how he makes his decision. ChaosTrader63 uses the default Ichimoku settings - 9, 26, 52, 26 and is a proponent of this settings rather than of the “crypto” settings.



ChaosTrader63 is originally a forex trader so his analysis has more precision in it than what you typically get in the cryptocurrency space. He combines Ichimoku cloud with fractal trading and high-volume support and resistance levels (a simplified version of trading ranges method which can be traced back to Wyckoff).

Below his webinar on Ichimoku High Probability Trading where he explains how one can decide on an entry. If you have mastered the basics and are looking to learn some more in the way of craftsmanship, I highly recommend him.

In the video below his decision process consists of first looking at the cloud setup and waiting for a price/oscillator divergence which only establishes the direction of the potential position and a level for the entry. When that’s done one ought to look for a price signal (bounce, rejection, indecision) and finally entering the trade when a trigger appears (violation of the signal - so for instance a high volume move after a period of indecision).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bullish signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a strong bullish signal, everything must occur above the Kumo cloud: The price action must remain &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; the Kumo cloud. The Chinkou line must stay &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; the kumo and Tenken should be crossing Kinjun also &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; the Kumo. Tenken should be crossing upside - if this cross occurs inside of the Kumo that’s still weakly bullish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bearish signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for strong bearish signal, with Ichimoku cloud you can pretty much reverse all that has been said to bullish signals - price action occurs &lt;strong&gt;below&lt;/strong&gt; Kumo, as well as Tenken and Kinjun crossing and the lagging line Chinkou. Basically the more happens below the stronger the bears are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BASICS: None of this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If none of this is happening then it most likely means that at your timeframe the market is &lt;em&gt;undecided, sideways, waiting for direction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChaosTrader63 is originally a forex trader so his analysis has more precision in it than what you typically get in the cryptocurrency space. He combines Ichimoku cloud with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvCKMg8ilMI&quot;&gt;fractal trading&lt;/a&gt; and high-volume support and resistance levels (a simplified version of &lt;a href=&quot;/strategy/wyckoff-ranging-markets&quot;&gt;trading ranges&lt;/a&gt; method which can be traced back to Wyckoff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below his webinar on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-eeW4SzWCA&quot;&gt;Ichimoku High Probability Trading&lt;/a&gt; where he explains how one can decide on an entry. If you have mastered the basics and are looking to learn some more in the way of craftsmanship, I highly recommend him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video below his decision process consists of first looking at the cloud setup and waiting for a price/oscillator divergence which only establishes the direction of the potential position and a level for the entry. When that’s done one ought to look for a price signal (bounce, rejection, indecision) and finally entering the trade when a trigger appears (violation of the signal - so for instance a high volume move after a period of indecision).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ The True Crypto Fundamentals: Crypto Mining and Transactions ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Crypto mining is the true fundamental limit of all PoW cryptocurrencies. Transactions, a somewhat softer fundamental, can also provide some guidance. Learn the basics of the nature of these crypto fundamentals. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Immutability as a fundamental

Cryptocurrencies operate in a drastically different way than fiat money as we know it today. Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain, a ledger that gets generated in a sequence that cannot be reshuffled.

Blockchain shares all of its data equally between its participants. Any changes brought to the blockchain are publicly recorded, and these records cannot be tampered with. That provides it with a digital, but nonetheless real fundamental - it is impossible to generate a coin out of thin air based on the order of some authority.

The only type of cryptocurrencies where this doesn’t hold true are IOU-type coins, such as some stablecoins.

Proof Of Work

Rather than keeping all data in a single central hub, on blockchain information gets distributed in nodes called blocks. To add new information to the blocks, a member of the network would have to provide the so-called proof of work, or PoW, by solving complex mathematical problems.

One type of such “new information” are crypto transactions. In the case of PoW cryptos, that’s also how new coins are made - a process called mining.

If you want to at first learn about the very basics, and if you at the same time like straight to the point stats and numbers, just scroll down to Bitcoinfy’s infographic below.

For more advanced stuff, keep reading!

Mining as a fundamental

In PoW mining, mining devices are set up to look for a solution of a mathematical problem. When a solution is found, a new block in the ledger is found; the block is broadcast and the miner collects a reward.

An important metric called “hashrate” is the speed at which mining devices are completing this operation. Higher hashrate in the network means there is higher opportunity of finding the next block and receiving the mining reward.

There have been only a few people who studied the relationship of hashrate with a PoW cryptocoin’s price, and the amount of traders who consider this is even lower.

It makes sense, because hashrate vs price dynamic in Bitcoin or other similar cryptos it is not a quick one to react. If most crypto traders are daytrading rather than making decisions for longer horizons (say, less than ten trades a year), naturally most people in the trading community will study momentarily chart patterns instead.

There are traders who claim that “Bitcoin is structured so that hashrate follows price”. The reason is meant to be the same one as the one that contributes to the jumpy character and overreactions we keep seeing in crypto: Vague and delayed decisions.

In a bear market, a lot of miners will keep mining at a loss, hoping they will survive long enough to realize the profit once the slump is over. Traders and hodlers do a very similar thing. When it starts looking like the price is reversing, pretty much no traders are jumping in until there is some sort of confirmation. In mining, as miners drop out, the profitability of mining will start increasing to lure them back in, but just as with traders, very few are eager to make that move without confirmation. Once that comes, a whole crowd of both traders and miners return to the market.

This is why crypto mining is a fundamental aspect of PoW cryptocurrencies: It limits the movements of the market.

If it is a limit, for a trader or an investor it will make more sense to look not at the short term hashrate movements but instead at the places where the direction changes.

For that, also consider “hashprice” instead of “hashrate”. Hash Price measures the daily mining profits, it is the ratio of daily mining revenue and the hashes generated per day. Hashrate fluctuates a lot, hashprice gives a much clearer picture.



On the chart from here you can see that both hashrate and hashprice of BTC started reversing upwards when the market overreacted with the drop to 3K USD.

        <title><![CDATA[ Shocking Facts About Cryptocurrency Heists [Infographics] ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Cryptojacking, ICO exits, scams, malware and thefts - outrageous amounts of cryptos have changed hands through illicit activity. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ If there is one question in the history of Bitcoin that cannot be answered with anything more than an estimate, it is the problem of how much of Bitcoin’s supply is actually ever available on the market. How much is locked up in wallets with lost keys, and how much is set to cool off for a few years because it was stolen?

As for the stolen crypto, the estimates are somewhat easier to make than for the cryptocoins that are “burned” and never to be moved again. According to Jameson Lopp, over 35% of Bitcoin’s supply has changed its owner in a heist - an estimate that draws from data on known cryptocurrency thefts and hacks.

With some alternative cryptocurrencies that are focused on anonymity more than the pseudonymous Bitcoin, the statistics get even more mind-blowing. According to one study, over 4% of Monero’s total supply is currently held by cybercriminals and hackers. At the price level on the day of publishing, that corresponds to over 37 million USD.

It’s no wonder that through 2018, cryptojacking became the most popular way to monetize cyber exploits. Cryptojacking, or illicit crypto mining, is done particularly easily for Monero and similar cryptocurrencies that have mining optimized for some form of ASIC-resistance. The original aim of that was to allow for wider community participation in mining by making it less profitable to use special single-purpose integrated circuits rather than your everyday ordinary laptop or phone.

The unintended but now prevailing effect is that cybercriminals can easily monetize access to any kind of infrastructure that has some spare disk space and memory - that’s practically any laptop or phone, but the juiciest plunder are the corporate ones as these usually have more available resources.

With cryptojacking, the owners or maintainers of the infected device typically have no idea there is a miner operating, and more sophisticated cryptojacking campaigns have developed various optimizations to stay under foot for as long as possible.

There are new ways of how malwares spread developed every day and the baseline of the cheap commodity malware you can buy for a couple of bucks is becoming more advanced every day.

It is safe to say that the malware industry has fully integrated the use of cryptocurrencies and is currently the most thriving cryptocurrency application.

        <title><![CDATA[ Cryptocurrency Branding 101: Naming a Cryptocurrency ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ The Perfect Name For Your Cryptocurrency Is Out There. Here’s How To Find It ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ This article, mainly targeting the entrepreneurs among you, is a guest post by Grant Polachek of Squadhelp. Grant is the Director of Marketing at Inc 500 company Squadhelp.com, the worlds #1 naming platform, with nearly 20,000 customers from the smallest startups across the globe to the largest corporations including Nestle, Philips, Hilton, Pepsi, and AutoNation. Get inspired by exploring these winning company name ideas.

Naming your business has become a vital part of launching your cryptocurrency.

The name will be the first thing that your potential user base will notice.

As you know, the cryptocurrency market can be so competitive in 2019. Your name needs to set you apart from the competition, draw people in and effectively sum up your brand.

The Challenge: Outline your brand

Even though naming can be a challenge for many crypto entrepreneurs, it should not have to feel like you’re stepping off an edge of a cliff with a blindfold over your eyes.

If you can follow the following three steps, you can organize your name ideas and get the most out of your cryptocurrency name.

Step One: Mission and Vision

Jot down a couple of current cryptocurrency names that you know are successful.

Simple, but it will really help you when it comes to brainstorming the ideas for your own brand name.

It is important to separate the process clearly: First, create a list of a few of your favorite existing brand names, only then begin to analyze them. You can get some inspiration from the directory of blockchain tech businesses on The Business Of Crypto.

Go through your list of catchy crypto business names to give yourself a head start on the naming process. You should be taking notes about what you specifically enjoy about each of the business name and why it is effective for the company.

Once you dissect all of your top existing business names, you will be able to reveal the direction that you want your naming process to take.


  Make sure you take notes on what exactly it is that you like about the names you are noting.
  Also write down if you want to capture a similar vibe to any of the names on your list.


Look ahead.

When coming up with a successful crypto brand name, you need to keep your eyes on the prize: Focus on where your business will go in the future.

Consider where you see your brand at in the next five years and even in the next 10 years. Will you be in a different place than where your brand is today?

If you want to create an innovative company that might grow into different areas in the future, you should be mindful when picking a name so you don’t pigeonhole yourself into a name with too narrow a scope.

Try to be concise when you summarize your mission and vision in a couple of short project statements like these examples:


  We need a name that captures our hip, special approach to tokenization.
  We need a name that establishes us as a youthful, energetic dApp game brand.
  We need a name that hints at our environmentally conscious business practices.


Why not get started by writing out a few project statements for your own startup based on your own values and beliefs.

Step Two: Get Creative

Gather some prospective names.

Brainstorm crypto business name ideas and write down a few potential examples based on every type of name that’s on the list you made in the first step.

This can be a really helpful step in the process to give you a good idea of what you’re looking for.

At this stage, go for the bulk: The more names you come up with, the better. This is how the idea of what name you want can start to crystallize.

Narrow your list.

Now that you have created a list of name candidates with a variety of ideas, you can start crossing off the names that don’t fit the vibe of your startup.

Keep crossing off names until you have only a few left and let it sit for a bit.

Discussing the short list with your team, an advisor and anyone else with a fresh insight will help you decide on the one brand name to go for.

Step Three: Check your Boxes

Before you set on a brand name for good, assess your risk with trademark validation.

Trademark validation for your cryptocurrency name is a useful way to ensure that your name is secure.

Running a trademark risk will give you the peace of mind that the name isn’t already in use by another project. If your name is too similar to another cryptocurrency, you may actually be in trouble in terms of trademark law - and the space is indeed getting crowded.

Make sure that you are proactive about protecting your name. If you evaluate your trademark risk before you lock in the name, you will be able to prevent any potential complicated legal issues.

Conclusion

Coming up with a strong brand name can feel like a daunting task for many entrepreneurs, not only in the blockchain business.

So much of your company’s success rests upon the name that you choose.

Your brand’s name should be the sum of your cryptocurrency’s identity, and it should serve as a point of connection between you and your audience.

Even if you feel like all the best names are already taken, don’t worry, the perfect name for your cryptocurrency is out there waiting for you to find it.

&lt;p&gt;The name will be the first thing that your potential user base will notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, the cryptocurrency market can be so competitive in 2019. Your name needs to set you apart from the competition, draw people in and effectively sum up your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge-outline-your-brand&quot;&gt;The Challenge: Outline your brand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though naming can be a challenge for many crypto entrepreneurs, it should not have to feel like you’re stepping off an edge of a cliff with a blindfold over your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can follow the following &lt;strong&gt;three steps&lt;/strong&gt;, you can organize your name ideas and get the most out of your cryptocurrency name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-one-mission-and-vision&quot;&gt;Step One: Mission and Vision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jot down a couple of current cryptocurrency names that you know are successful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple, but it will really help you when it comes to brainstorming the ideas for your own brand name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to separate the process clearly: First, create a list of a few of your favorite existing brand names, only then begin to analyze them. You can get some inspiration from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/company/&quot;&gt;directory of blockchain tech businesses&lt;/a&gt; on The Business Of Crypto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through your list of catchy crypto business names to give yourself a head start on the naming process. You should be taking notes about what you specifically enjoy about each of the business name and why it is effective for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you dissect all of your top existing business names, you will be able to reveal the direction that you want your naming process to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you take notes on what exactly it is that you like about the names you are noting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also write down if you want to capture a similar vibe to any of the names on your list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coming up with a successful crypto brand name, you need to keep your eyes on the prize: &lt;strong&gt;Focus on where your business will go in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider where you see your brand at in the next five years and even in the next 10 years. Will you be in a different place than where your brand is today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to create an innovative company that might grow into different areas in the future, you should be mindful when picking a name so you don’t pigeonhole yourself into a name with too narrow a scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to be concise when you summarize your mission and vision in a couple of short project statements like these examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need a name that captures our hip, special approach to tokenization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need a name that establishes us as a youthful, energetic dApp game brand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need a name that hints at our environmentally conscious business practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not get started by writing out a few project statements for your own startup based on your own values and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-two-get-creative&quot;&gt;Step Two: Get Creative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gather some prospective names.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainstorm crypto business name ideas and write down a few potential examples based on every type of name that’s on the list you made in the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be a really helpful step in the process to give you a good idea of what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, go for the bulk: The more names you come up with, the better. This is how the idea of what name you want can start to crystallize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrow your list.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have created a list of name candidates with a variety of ideas, you can start crossing off the names that &lt;strong&gt;don’t fit the vibe&lt;/strong&gt; of your startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep crossing off names until you have only a few left and let it sit for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing the short list with your team, an advisor and anyone else with a fresh insight will help you decide on the one brand name to go for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-three-check-your-boxes&quot;&gt;Step Three: Check your Boxes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you set on a brand name for good, assess your risk with trademark validation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/276455&quot;&gt;Trademark validation&lt;/a&gt; for your cryptocurrency name is a useful way to ensure that your name is secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a trademark risk will give you the peace of mind that the name isn’t already in use by another project. If your name is too similar to another cryptocurrency, you may actually be in trouble in terms of trademark law - and the space is indeed getting crowded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you are proactive about protecting your name. If you evaluate your trademark risk before you lock in the name, you will be able to prevent any potential complicated legal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming up with a strong brand name can feel like a daunting task for many entrepreneurs, not only in the blockchain business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of your company’s success rests upon the name that you choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your brand’s name should be the sum of your cryptocurrency’s identity, and it should serve as a &lt;strong&gt;point of connection&lt;/strong&gt; between you and your audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you feel like all the best names are already taken, don’t worry, the perfect name for your cryptocurrency is out there waiting for you to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Samourai Wallet has released an update that contributes heaps to Bitcoin's fungibility ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ The 'Bitcoin wallet for the streets' deserves every bit of that marketing slogan. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ On January 21st, Samourai Wallet released an update that makes an important step towards the fungibility of Bitcoin as a payment vehicle.

When we consider the potential of cryptocurrencies to be used as money, Bitcoin has the undisputed advantage of adoption: Everyone knows what Bitcoin is, it has been used in peer-to-peer transactions for years, there are relatively easy ways to store it.



By now, Bitcoin as a payment method has somewhat solidified by sticking around for so long.

One of the disadvantages though is the fact that Bitcoin’s blockchain is public. In many corners of the cryptocurrency community, this is even the main reason for Monero’s existence.

Nonetheless, there is the opposing argument as well - You only need stealth privacy quite rarely. And so, do we really need a separate crypto-money just for these rare cases? A separate blockchain for stealth transactions?

This article cannot provide an answer to that question - in time, the market will decide.

If you subscribe to the philosophy that it is not feasible to hold multiple cryptocurrencies for different uses, you will most likely benefit from what Samourai Wallet has been working on.

Staggered Ricochet

Samourai Wallet really deserves to call itself “the bitcoin wallet for the streets”. The first version of Samourai wallet came to existence during the bear market of 2015 already with the intention to offer some built-in transaction anonymizing function; ever since this angle kept only improving.

The new “Staggered Ricochet” is an extension of an existing premium option for BTC transactions called simply “Ricochet”. Ricochet is not a mixing function, but it helps to increase your plausible deniability by adding hops into your transaction - the principle is similar to relay hops used by Tor, the anonymous deep web browser.

Ricochet makes your transaction somewhat slower and somewhat more expensive, because you are inserting extra transactions between your starting address and the destination address.

Staggered Ricochet is a take on some advanced issues that are emerging as blockchain transaction analytics becomes more advanced. This update improves Ricochet by making its tell-tale patterns less recognizable: Staggered Ricochet makes sure each hop-transaction gets mined in a different block and also, each hop-transaction will only first be exposed to the mempool when it is just ready to be broadcast.

Explanation from Samourai Wallet’s blog:


  One of the clever ways of fingerprinting transactions that blockchain spies have been known to use is monitoring the mempool and using associated metadata including time first broadcast to assist in their address clustering heuristics. To help break that method Staggered Ricochet transactions will not be exposed to the public mempool until they are ready to be broadcast.


Cost and Time

On the expense side, Samourai Wallet with the Staggered Ricochet option is a good fit for  the philosophy of using stealth privacy only once in a while: As with simple Ricochet, you are paying extra fees for the hops, and additionally, a Staggered Ricochet transaction will potentially take up to a few hours to confirm because of the block restriction. You do not want to use it every time, and you don’t want to buy your coffee this way.

For the cases where you want privacy though, I would argue that state-of-the-art enhancements like the Staggered Ricochet can even be a safer option than using a private cryptocurrency: You are adding extra hops to a very busy public blockchain in a manner that cannot be easily detected.

If you choose to pay with a cryptocurrency known for its focus on anonymous transations, by doing so you are advertising that this particular transation really needs to stay hidden. All it takes is a vulnerability that breaks that ledger’s anonymity - which by all means can happen.



Samourai Wallet is available for free at samouraiwallet.com/download.

As for smartphones, the app is currently only available for Android. If you are a slightly more advanced user, you can run the Android app on your computer via VirtualBox - a how-to guide here.

        <title><![CDATA[ Michael Foster of LocalEthereum: Venezuela could be start of something bigger ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Chat about the business of P2P trading, challenges of crypto OTC and how a poor country can matter for the future of crypto. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Just in case you didn’t figure it out, LocalEthereum is a peer-to-peer marketplace for Ethereum.

Unlike LocalBitcoins and most other OTC markets LocalEthereum is a dApp running on smart contract escrow and built-in encryption of all communication between the peers who are about to make a trade.

Also still unlike most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms, LocalEthereum is fully non-custodial. You get your own private key upon sign-up, there is no hot wallet to get hacked and no personal communication to leak. Proof of keys, proof of cash.

They are the technically most superior retail OTC platform we currently have in crypto but they are definitely not slumbering: For 2019 LocalEthereum plans to implement self-sovereign KYC as a way for traders to verify each other’s identity without trusting LocalEthereum with any personal information.

LocalEthereum did all that with no ICO, no VC money and not even what would most people call a team: Just two co-founders coding and responding to customer support tickets.

We sat down with Michael Foster, one of the dApp’s co-founders, to chat about Ethereum P2P trading in the past year, challenges of the business and his opinions on blockchain and state.

If you don’t have an account on LocalEthereum, make one here.





“The boom forced us to learn how to keep up, the bear market reminded us to stay frugal and remain strategic and careful.” (LocalEthereum Blog)



According to the stats from dAppRadar, daily active users on LocalEthereum have been falling through 2018 but the daily traded volumes have been steadily increasing. That means the trade has been growing, even though the number of participants has decreased.

It looks very optimistic for a year of bear market, was it the result of a targeted marketing strategy?

We definitely had to get creative with our marketing.

These days you need to think outside the box when you want to advertise in the cryptocurrency space. You’re not allowed to advertise on mainstream platforms - not only Google but also Facebook, Twitter and even Reddit.

At first, we would place our ads on niche cryptocurrency websites, but the costs of this kind of advertising skyrocketed in early 2018. There was a lot of money in the blockchain industry still from the 2017 token sale boom.

Essentially, we ended up competing for ad slots with projects that had hundreds millions of dollars in ICO money. Instead of trying to outbid them, we decided to focus on encouraging word of mouth.

That means stellar customer service?

That’s only one part of the problem. With a clunky platform you won’t create positive customer experiences no matter how excellent the customer service is.

Our strategy is to design the platform as user-friendly as possible, and on top of that we are always there to help people if they get stuck.

As a co-founder, I probably talk to thirty-plus customers each day on Telegram, sometimes late at night.

We listen and we iterate; traders who have been around since the beginning will notice the platform looks very different today compared to when we launched.

I think this proactive approach encouraged word of mouth a lot.

People often underestimate how much a small team can achieve, even without overwhelming funding. But still, you launched in October 2017 right into the peak of the cryptocurrency bubble. How did you handle the first months after launch?

There was a lot that couldn’t be predicted. The market was a roller coaster as usual, and LocalEthereum’s volume generally follows the overall market.

In the early months of 2018, we had a huge influx of signups from a mainstream audience. Our platform had only just launched then, and we weren’t ready for the overwhelming demand.

We spent hours each day brainstorming ways to simplify the user interface, and to rephrase our user guides so that laymen would understand them.

At the time, LocalEthereum was only two people.

Customer support itself became just too much to handle. At the height of the 2018 boom, I would routinely wake up to one-hundred-plus new support tickets.

Eventually we had to hire some help for our customer support desk. There weren’t enough hours in the day for us to handle customer support on top of development and everything else.

So as your user base gradually changed in 2018 along with the changes on the market, did you also notice a geographical shift?

When we launched, we had no expectations for the countries in top positions.

In terms of trade activity, Venezuela is our top country.

In terms of trading volumes, China and Russia are leading, but we have users in almost every country in the world. Other popular countries are the U.S., the U.K., Spain, New Zealand and India.

If you asked me in 2017, I wouldn’t have guessed that Venezuela would be our number one country. I might have said it would be in our top ten, but I wouldn’t have guessed it would be number one.

Many people argue the notorious interest in cryptocurrencies in Venezuela doesn’t matter. It is not a rich country after all, the amount of money a Venezuelan can bring to the cryptocurrency markets is quite small.

I don’t think the interest in crypto from Venezuela doesn’t matter. I think it could be the start of something bigger.

Seeing the growing number of LocalEthereum users from there brought me back to why I found interest in Bitcoin in 2010: Cryptocurrency has the potential to rapidly accelerate economic freedom.

Freedom is necessary for societies to progress - that’s a fact that many leaders sadly don’t understand, particularly in countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Iran and Cuba.

In my opinion, Venezuela is the most important country for developers and crypto-evangelists to focus on, and I think it could become a great example for the rest of the world once it is “flipped” to a blockchain-based economy.

That’s not an exaggeration, in my opinion the flip is totally possible.

I’m excited about cryptocurrency lifting oppressed people out of depressed economies. If I can help by providing tools people use to prosper without the state, even better.

On LocalEthereum we’ve done a lot to accommodate the demand from Latin America. The website is now available in Spanish, we opened a new Spanish telegram group, and we hired community staff in Venezuela. I’ve been learning Spanish as well, but I’m not very good.

If the flip to blockchain-based economy were to happen, peer-to-peer marketplaces would probably play an important role in it - this type of activity can initiate changes in the bottom-up direction.

Quite in general, what do you think are the biggest bottlenecks for people who are getting into P2P trading?

The biggest obstacle to P2P trading is getting your head around the whole process, especially if you’re coming from exchange trading.

One thing is your personal security and responsibility for your cryptocurrency holdings. Centralized exchanges hold your crypto for you at all times, but LocalEthereum is a non-custodial marketplace.

Second thing is trading without order books. Trading exchanges have bids and asks lined up in centralized order books and matched automatically with a matching algorithm.
On a P2P platform, users need to manually choose a person to trade with. That concept is very new and strange to some people.

Then there are also the scammers. How do you deal with abuse of the platform?

Yeah, scammers can be tricky to deal with, but I think their presence is sometimes overstated.

User reputation is a really useful tool here. At the end of each trade, users are asked to rate each other. If a user’s feedback score is very low or if they get reported, they’ll be booted from the platform.

Most types of scams can be prevented with better guides and education. Once you are aware of the scam, you know what to watch out for.

For example, the most common scam is to convince the seller to send ETH outside of escrow. The scammer will put their Ethereum address in a chat message and convince the other party to transfer ETH directly to them, before they vanish with the funds.

We’ve mostly solved this by having a loud warning message pop up whenever a user posts an Ethereum address via a chat message.

Another very common scam is for the buyer to send a fake transfer receipt and trick the seller into releasing the escrow early.

We’re now working on an improved user-interface that will clearly explain the escrow process to new users because it’s usually people brand new to cryptocurrency who are prey to scams like this. We’re also going to publish video guides later in the year.

How about more advanced abuse, like the free option scam?

You are referring to people using P2P markets as free options contracts especially during volatile times, which is a more complex maneuver.

I don’t know if it can be technically called a scam because both parties receive what they agreed upon in the end, however it can be a problem.

It does lock up the seller’s funds in the escrow, so they are potentially losing money they could otherwise use in an actual trade.

Yeah. How this works is that a buyer will lock in a trade at some rate, and then stay silent for an hour or so. If the market moves up in that period, they’ll complete the trade because they can sell the ETH immediately for a profit; if the market moves down, they’ll cancel the trade.

This kind of behaviour is tricky to detect or prevent from our side, however it can definitely be improved with better guides and education.

As a trader, you can minimize the impact of this by limiting the trade size for users you have never traded with before.

In general, if you are a P2P trader, these risks should be reflected in your pricing rather than regulated by the platform.

One last question: What is in store for LocalEthereum in 2019?

One thing you can expect in 2019 is changes to the user-interface, and even the homepage will have a makeover.

We want to make P2P trading simple for everyone, whether you are learning about Ethereum for the first time ever, or you have been trading Bitcoin since 2012.

We have some more announcements coming in the first months of 2019. Unfortunately I can’t announce some things yet; it’s too early and I don’t want to spoil a good surprise.

Take a look around at localethereum.com.

&lt;p&gt;They are the technically most superior retail OTC platform we currently have in crypto but they are definitely not slumbering: For 2019 LocalEthereum plans to implement &lt;strong&gt;self-sovereign KYC&lt;/strong&gt; as a way for traders to verify each other’s identity without trusting LocalEthereum with any personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LocalEthereum did all that with &lt;strong&gt;no ICO&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;no VC money&lt;/strong&gt; and not even what would most people call a team: Just &lt;strong&gt;two co-founders&lt;/strong&gt; coding and responding to customer support tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We sat down with Michael Foster, one of the dApp’s co-founders, to chat about Ethereum P2P trading in the past year, challenges of the business and his opinions on blockchain and state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t have an account on LocalEthereum, make one &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/local-meth&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/localethereum-office.jpg&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Michael Foster of LocalEthereum: Venezuela could be start of something bigger&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/localethereum-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Michael Foster of LocalEthereum: Venezuela could be start of something bigger&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Michael Foster of LocalEthereum: Venezuela could be start of something bigger&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The boom forced us to learn how to keep up, the bear market reminded us to stay frugal and remain strategic and careful.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.localethereum.com/reflecting-on-2018-and-building-a-colossal-2019/&quot;&gt;LocalEthereum Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dappradar.com/app/148/localethereum&quot;&gt;stats from dAppRadar&lt;/a&gt;, daily active users on LocalEthereum have been falling through 2018 but the daily traded volumes have been steadily increasing. That means the trade has been growing, even though the number of participants has decreased.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks very optimistic for a year of bear market, was it the result of a targeted marketing strategy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We definitely had to get creative with our marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days you need to think outside the box when you want to advertise in the cryptocurrency space. You’re not allowed to advertise on mainstream platforms - not only Google but also Facebook, Twitter and even Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, we would place our ads on niche cryptocurrency websites, but the costs of this kind of advertising skyrocketed in early 2018. There was a lot of money in the blockchain industry still from the 2017 token sale boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we ended up competing for ad slots with projects that had hundreds millions of dollars in ICO money. Instead of trying to outbid them, we decided to focus on encouraging word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That means stellar customer service?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s only one part of the problem. With a clunky platform you won’t create positive customer experiences no matter how excellent the customer service is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our strategy is to design the platform as user-friendly as possible, and on top of that we are always there to help people if they get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a co-founder, I probably talk to thirty-plus customers each day on Telegram, sometimes late at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We listen and we iterate; traders who have been around since the beginning will notice the platform looks very different today compared to when we launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this proactive approach encouraged word of mouth a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People often underestimate how much a small team can achieve, even without overwhelming funding. But still, you launched in October 2017 right into the peak of the cryptocurrency bubble. How did you handle the first months after launch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot that couldn’t be predicted. The market was a roller coaster as usual, and LocalEthereum’s volume generally follows the overall market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early months of 2018, we had a huge influx of signups from a mainstream audience. Our platform had only just launched then, and we weren’t ready for the overwhelming demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent hours each day brainstorming ways to simplify the user interface, and to rephrase our user guides so that laymen would understand them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, LocalEthereum was only two people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer support itself became just too much to handle. At the height of the 2018 boom, I would routinely wake up to one-hundred-plus new support tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we had to hire some help for our customer support desk. There weren’t enough hours in the day for us to handle customer support on top of development and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So as your user base gradually changed in 2018 along with the changes on the market, did you also notice a geographical shift?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we launched, we had no expectations for the countries in top positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of trade activity, Venezuela is our top country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of trading volumes, China and Russia are leading, but we have users in almost every country in the world. Other popular countries are the U.S., the U.K., Spain, New Zealand and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you asked me in 2017, I wouldn’t have guessed that Venezuela would be our number one country. I might have said it would be in our top ten, but I wouldn’t have guessed it would be number one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many people argue the notorious interest in cryptocurrencies in Venezuela doesn’t matter. It is not a rich country after all, the amount of money a Venezuelan can bring to the cryptocurrency markets is quite small.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the interest in crypto from Venezuela doesn’t matter. I think it could be the start of something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing the growing number of LocalEthereum users from there brought me back to why I found interest in Bitcoin in 2010: Cryptocurrency has the potential to rapidly accelerate economic freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom is necessary for societies to progress - that’s a fact that many leaders sadly don’t understand, particularly in countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Iran and Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Venezuela is the most important country for developers and crypto-evangelists to focus on, and I think it could become a great example for the rest of the world once it is “flipped” to a blockchain-based economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not an exaggeration, in my opinion the flip is totally possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited about cryptocurrency lifting oppressed people out of depressed economies. If I can help by providing tools people use to prosper without the state, even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On LocalEthereum we’ve done a lot to accommodate the demand from Latin America. The website is now available in Spanish, we opened a new Spanish telegram group, and we hired community staff in Venezuela. I’ve been learning Spanish as well, but I’m not very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the flip to blockchain-based economy were to happen, peer-to-peer marketplaces would probably play an important role in it - this type of activity can initiate changes in the bottom-up direction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quite in general, what do you think are the biggest bottlenecks for people who are getting into P2P trading?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle to P2P trading is getting your head around the whole process, especially if you’re coming from exchange trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is your personal security and responsibility for your cryptocurrency holdings. Centralized exchanges hold your crypto for you at all times, but LocalEthereum is a non-custodial marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second thing is trading without order books. Trading exchanges have bids and asks lined up in centralized order books and matched automatically with a matching algorithm.
On a P2P platform, users need to manually choose a person to trade with. That concept is very new and strange to some people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then there are also the scammers. How do you deal with abuse of the platform?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, scammers can be tricky to deal with, but I think their presence is sometimes overstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User reputation is a really useful tool here. At the end of each trade, users are asked to rate each other. If a user’s feedback score is very low or if they get reported, they’ll be booted from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most types of scams can be prevented with better guides and education. Once you are aware of the scam, you know what to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the most common scam is to convince the seller to send ETH outside of escrow. The scammer will put their Ethereum address in a chat message and convince the other party to transfer ETH directly to them, before they vanish with the funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve mostly solved this by having a loud warning message pop up whenever a user posts an Ethereum address via a chat message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very common scam is for the buyer to send a fake transfer receipt and trick the seller into releasing the escrow early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now working on an improved user-interface that will clearly explain the escrow process to new users because it’s usually people brand new to cryptocurrency who are prey to scams like this. We’re also going to publish video guides later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about more advanced abuse, like the free option scam?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are referring to people using P2P markets as free options contracts especially during volatile times, which is a more complex maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if it can be technically called a scam because both parties receive what they agreed upon in the end, however it can be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It does lock up the seller’s funds in the escrow, so they are potentially losing money they could otherwise use in an actual trade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. How this works is that a buyer will lock in a trade at some rate, and then stay silent for an hour or so. If the market moves up in that period, they’ll complete the trade because they can sell the ETH immediately for a profit; if the market moves down, they’ll cancel the trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of behaviour is tricky to detect or prevent from our side, however it can definitely be improved with better guides and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a trader, you can minimize the impact of this by limiting the trade size for users you have never traded with before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, if you are a P2P trader, these risks should be reflected in your pricing rather than regulated by the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One last question: What is in store for LocalEthereum in 2019?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you can expect in 2019 is changes to the user-interface, and even the homepage will have a makeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make P2P trading simple for everyone, whether you are learning about Ethereum for the first time ever, or you have been trading Bitcoin since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have some more announcements coming in the first months of 2019. Unfortunately I can’t announce some things yet; it’s too early and I don’t want to spoil a good surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take a look around at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/local-meth&quot;&gt;localethereum.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Stats from 2018 - Readers like Melancholic 100x and Ledger ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Look at one tiny piece of the economy of crypto for payments. Plus a look at search and traffic stats for hardware wallets and what it probably means. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ It is the last day of 2018 when I’m writing this post, so let me wish all the best to you and to crypto in the year 2019.

And because it’s the end of year I thought I might look at the stats of this blog for once (we’re very diligent and professional around here).

I found a couple of funny things to share with you and then one bit that you might actually factor into your support and resistance line-drawing art next year. That is, in the case crypto wanted to start moving up north again.

BitMEX, Ledger Wallet and Airdrops

Here’s the fun part of the stats that tells a lot about the readers of this blog:

1/ People are far more curious about TensorCharts than about other charting app mentioner here, but in terms of actual registrations TradingView still wins heavily.

That means we’ll have to add some more guides for TensorCharts, the learning curve is obviously an issue.


  TradingView
  TensorCharts


2/ Apparently for the readers of this blog, Trezor wallet is of absolutely zero interest other than occasionally checking back if they didn’t implement that Monero support after all.

While globally, Trezor and Ledger are contenders with nearly the same traffic. Ledger has a better affiliate program so people are more vocal about it, and it’s also cheaper than Trezor.

I personally find Trezor more user-friendly but hey ho.


  Ledger


3/ People go check out various exchanges but by far mostly sign up at BitMEX.

You guys are sick gamblers.


  BitMEX 10% fee OFF


4/ There is a good segment of readers who are only interested in airdrops and nothing else on this website.

All power to you, brothers and sisters.


  Airdrops


Where to expect the salty breakeven sellers

Now for the more substantial part.

Google Trends shows nicely the organic search interest for Ledger Nano S, Trezor and Keepkey - each the strongest keyword for each brand by the amount of traffic it brings in. The trendlines are pretty much the same for the “buy” search phrases.

The price of Bitcoin hit its current ATH of just below 20k USD on December 18, 2017. The peak search interest for hardware wallets occurred between December 10, 2017 and January 6, 2018. For Ledger especially the peak was leaning to the later dates of the range, people were “buying the dip” of the top range.

If you pull BTCUSD price data from Yahoo Finance (relevant chunk of the CSV on Keybase), daily closes for the time span give you an average buying price of around 15.5k USD per Bitcoin.

That is when majority of the retail bought in, or so it seems, and so there will probably be quite some salty breakeven sellers between 15-16k like there were around twelve hundred.

Even if a lot of the search interest didn’t lead to purchase of the wallet (or crypto), it is worth mentioning that according to SEMRush the traffic of trezor.io jumped from 4k a day to 25k visitors a day during December 2017 alone. Ledger.com gained a lot of traffic but the data is not as good because they were also slowly migrating from ledgerwallet.com to ledger.com.

What is perhaps more interesting is that both trezor.io and ledger.com maintained the new higher level of traffic through all of 2018, at least according to SEMRush. Since November apparently both sites appear to be breaking upwards but that can be a Black Friday thing.

Nonetheless, studying organic search for wallets is losing meaning just like it happened with generic bitcoin or crypto queries: People already know the products, they won’t google them anymore.

According to Alexa 80-90% of Trezor’s and Ledger’s traffic is referral or direct. People mostly come from places like MyEtherWallet, Youtube and blogs.

Doesn’t look like very dead to me, folks.

        <title><![CDATA[ How Blockchain Disrupts the Entertainment Industry ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ This is a brief report on the state of blockchain implementations in the entertainment industry. What has been done, what are the most promising concepts and where are any potential bottlenecks aside from the ingrained conservative nature of the entertainment business. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Entertainment business has long struggled with the gatekeeper problem.

So many barriers to overcome before you just barely crack the surface: Record deals, distribution rights, funding, you name it.

But even the entertainment industry is being flipped on its head with the arrival of the internet age and the democratization of content.

Through platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix, content is already being made more accessible and the road does not stop there. As the frustration over red tape continues to grow, people are looking for more ways to disrupt the industry and drive power back to where it deserves to be.

One way to do so is through blockchain technology. According to an article on CryptoDigest, the technology is already in the full swing of disrupting industries like healthcare, banking or agriculture.

It’s only a matter of time before crypto works its magic on entertainment, too. This is a brief report on the state of blockchain implementations in the entertainment industry, what has been done, what are the most promising concepts and where are any potential bottlenecks aside from the ingrained conservative nature of the entertainment business.

Blockchain to re-empower the artist

In entertainment, middlemen aren’t always a good thing. Too many parties involved will lead to hijacking of content, unbalanced income streams and loss of distribution control.

Blockchain-powered systems forge a more direct relationship between the artist and their audience. This is able to shave off critical costs and generate better returns for the artist.

One of the early innovators who tapped into blockchain for the music industry is Imogen Heap. In 2015, the Grammy-winning artist made use of the Ethereum Blockchain-based Ujo platform to distribute her song Tiny Human. This solution allowed her to price her song at just $0.60 per download — a substantial markdown from the usual pricing of $1 and up.

Blockchain for crowdfunding and fair trade relationships

The entertainment business belongs to the industries that forgot to innovate for the past few decades and its bureaucratic model is ripe for disruption.

Blockchain technology is creating more funding options, consequently more people get to earn their slice of the media pie.

SingularDTV, for example, invites fans to become investors themselves. This platform for funding of movie creation collates all forms of crypto and fiat currencies. This way it creates new liquidity in line with cryptocurrency exchanges and the 21M trading wallet.

The SingularDTV system targets everyone with a story to tell but without the means to deliver it to an audience. The innovative bit though is that it also provides an opportunity for fans to support and earn from films they actually like. This form of rewarding the fans is completely new and unprecedented.

Decentralized talent management

Because there are limited resources to scout every potential superstar out there, it is inevitable that some well-deserved talents end up fading in the background. Even for talents that are found, the struggle with funding is still real.

In sports, especially, young athletes have a difficult time covering their expenses when starting out.

TokenStars is the first to recognize this gap and to employ blockchain technology to facilitate deal-breaking support for upcoming sportsmen.

Funding for athletes opens up a wealth of possibilities and resources that can propel them to success — from better coaches and health support, to quality equipment and training.

Conducive collaboration between developers and publishers

Collaboration is the pulse of the entertainment industry, but it’s not always easy to do.

Smart Contracts can create a more streamlined approach to managing multiple teams and ensuring each member sticks to a pre-determined agreement.

In gaming, companies like Bounties Network and Qravity are connecting video game publishers to developers, tracking their contributions to new titles, and settling their wages via smart contracts.

Limitations ob blockchain tech: The price of transparency

Despite these exciting possibilities, however, blockchain technology still has its limitations.

An article focused on blockchain’s limitations by FXCM notes that while it has undoubtedly contributed to greater transparency and protection of intellectual property, it comes with the caveat of having to address the need for confidentiality.

Companies have to remember that preserving data privacy and commercial transparency doesn’t equate to integrity. At the end of the day, confidentiality terms must be agreed upon.

All in all, blockchain technology has yet to mature fully. It may take a while before it can be adopted into the vast Hollywood mainstream — a territory that is known to play it safe and stick to tradition.

But as history has proven, at the end of the day innovation is inevitable in business if one wants to stay afloat.

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Entertainment business has long struggled with &lt;strong&gt;the gatekeeper problem&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many barriers to overcome before you just barely crack the surface: Record deals, distribution rights, funding, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even the entertainment industry is being flipped on its head with the arrival of the internet age and the democratization of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix, content is already being made more accessible and the road does not stop there. As the frustration over red tape continues to grow, people are looking for more ways to disrupt the industry and drive power back to where it deserves to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to do so is through blockchain technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptodigestnews.com/5-industries-blockchain-is-disrupting-d219611b029c&quot;&gt;According to an article on CryptoDigest&lt;/a&gt;, the technology is already in the full swing of disrupting industries like healthcare, banking or agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s only a matter of time before crypto works its magic on entertainment, too. This is a brief report on the state of blockchain implementations in the entertainment industry, what has been done, what are the most promising concepts and where are any potential bottlenecks aside from the ingrained conservative nature of the entertainment business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blockchain-to-re-empower-the-artist&quot;&gt;Blockchain to re-empower the artist&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In entertainment, middlemen aren’t always a good thing. &lt;strong&gt;Too many parties involved&lt;/strong&gt; will lead to hijacking of content, unbalanced income streams and loss of distribution control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain-powered systems forge a more direct relationship between the artist and their audience. This is able to shave off critical costs and generate better returns for the artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the early innovators who tapped into blockchain for the music industry is Imogen Heap. In 2015, the Grammy-winning artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/blockchain-disrupting-music-mycelia&quot;&gt;made use of the Ethereum Blockchain-based Ujo platform&lt;/a&gt; to distribute her song &lt;em&gt;Tiny Human&lt;/em&gt;. This solution allowed her to price her song at just $0.60 per download — a substantial markdown from the usual pricing of $1 and up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blockchain-for-crowdfunding-and-fair-trade-relationships&quot;&gt;Blockchain for crowdfunding and fair trade relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entertainment business belongs to the industries that forgot to innovate for the past few decades and its &lt;strong&gt;bureaucratic model&lt;/strong&gt; is ripe for disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology is creating more funding options, consequently more people get to earn their slice of the media pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SingularDTV, for example, invites fans to become investors themselves. This platform for funding of movie creation collates all forms of crypto and fiat currencies. This way it creates new liquidity in line with cryptocurrency exchanges and the 21M trading wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Want to buy a house with bitcoin? ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ You very well can, no matter how much you hear on Reddit and elsewhere that nobody actually wants to use bitcoins for transactions. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ This came to us from the guys at OpenListings.com. In their blog about buying a house with bitcoin they do admit the demand rose very much through the 2017 hype.

Most of all, some new people now have money to spend, often for the first time ever in their lives. At the same time, the perspective of BTC hitting 19k USD again at some point makes it psychologically somewhat attractive to hold on to. Certainly more attractive than a lot of extra USD generated from the sale of a property, as we know USD will never hit very much at all in terms of the upside.

As the good people from Open Listings dryly put it, after 2017 there are only two things certain if you work in the real estate business:

  Your parents will ask you to explain what the hell bitcoin is over and over again.
  Your clients who’ve mined their way to crypto riches will want to know if there is a way for them to buy a house with Bitcoin.


And indeed, the real estate market doesn’t wait for blockchain political in-fights to pass nor for a sacrament of ETF approval to be granted before securing their piece of the pie.

There are still bottlenecks

Buying a house involves number of people and organizations, usually it’s not just the buyer and the seller. Even though the situation is getting better fast, there may still be bottlenecks.


  
    The seller has to be down - You can find available sellers by appending “Bitcoin” or “Ethereum” to your search. Chances are, people who will not be willing to sell for crypto unless they explicitly say so in their listing.
  
  
    The title and escrow companies have to agree to handle your transaction. It is still tricky to find insurance and escrow companies comfortable with cryptocurrency transactions. It may be the case that the escrow will require you to cash out your cryptocurrency first. You still should not be denied fiat money that was until recently in cryptocurrency, which routinely happens when putting down a payment for mortgage.
  


Come have a look

Here is a taster of what is out there to be had for your bitcoins in California and Washington, US.

These particular properties have been sold already but feel free to browse around. You will be surprised, it’s not only super posh frat boys who is being targeted.



6023 W Beachwood Ln. Los Angeles, CA 90038

1301 Duhig Rd Napa, CA 94559

        <title><![CDATA[ Follow the money: Who's banking on IOU stablecoins? ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Why is suddenly everyone in such a rush to create a regulated IOU stablecoin? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ While some of the marketing speak surrounding stablecoins revolves around creating a fully independent crypto ecosystem without the greedy banks, banks are the ones capitalizing here.

Adopted from the Weekly Market Commentary from TradeBlock, October 15, 2018:

Circle recently launched its own IOU stablecoin, USDC, backed by USD reserves. Circle has built out a separate entity, CENTRE, to act as a governance structure and networking entity that financial institutions opt into in order to mint new USDC stable coins. CENTRE is not the issuer of the stablecoin, the member institutions are.

According to CENTRE white paper, these member institutions are then responsible for issuing the coins and are audited by CENTRE to make sure the reserve is there.

This process works in a similar way for all IOU stablecoins: Verified customer sends a cash deposit to a member of CENTRE, the member then mints the stablecoin equivalent and sends the amount to the customer.

The issuing member now holds the cash deposit, the customer holds the stablecoin.

The issuing member is a money business or a bank: In the case of CENTRE, the only issuer (for now) is Circle. In other IOU stablecoin solutions, as well as with USDC in the future, the deposit may go to a regular bank. Circle itself is actively looking to become a federally licensed bank in the US.

But unlike with a regular customer deposit, in this case the bank is not paying interest to the depositor.

TradeBlock suggests that for USDC these banking institutions would hold the cash deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank: “As the FED raises interest rates (another rate hike is expected in 2018 and three rate hikes for 2019) these banking institutions could stand to benefit as greater interest is paid on these cash holdings.”

In other words, according to TradeBlock banks lucky enough to partner with an IOU stablecoin might stand to earn more money on customer deposits than they would if you simply held your fiat with them, because then they’d have to pay you interest.

Tether is in a vulnerable position

This fact suggests that banks would now want to compete for depositors. Decreasing trust in a vulnerable competing stablecoin solution is probably very good news everyone else in the same line of business.

The CENTRE whitepaper mentions the problems we have seen Tether have, albeit without naming any names. It simply states that they created a separate governance structure with independent stablecoin issuers to increase transparency and minimize adverse effects should issues arise (although it seems dubious to have a single, supposedly fungible token issued and backed by different independent institutions).

Tether seems to be too inter-related with Bitfinex to salvage any transparency for now: The executive members of both organizations are the same people, both companies are BVI entities, most information is tied up in non-disclosure agreements and on top of it, due to banking problems it appears that Bitfinex is now the actual issuer/de-issuer of Tether. Which is fine, if the USD reserve is there, but that is an information that is not to be publicly disclosed.

It cannot be said convincingly whether Tether is solvent or not but given the current situation it would be strange if nobody attempted to profit from this vulnerable position that Tether and Bitfinex are in.

Which is fine, if the USD reserve is there, but that is an information that is not to be publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It cannot be said convincingly whether Tether is solvent or not but given the current situation it would be strange if nobody attempted to profit from this vulnerable position that Tether and Bitfinex are in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Tokenization can boost startups in growing industries like home remodeling ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Houzz launched its new cryptocurrency for home remodeling earlier this year. Is this a good initiative for startups like Renovaten? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Home improvement business is projected to grow in near future, involving blockchain is just one way to increase the worth of industry.

Though cryptocurrencies already have a sizeable global footprint and faced some tough time in finding real-world value, in 2018 many businesses are just starting to tokenize their assets and services by launching their own proprietary cryptocurrencies.

Houzz, the online community for architecture and interior design, did just that in April 2018 when theyr announced their ICO.

The company launched Houzzcoinzz, cryptocurrency tokens designed exclusively for their potential users. It mimics the functionality of an in-store gift card but additionally, the token can be mined. Also, being publicly traded, the Houzzcoinzz fluctuate in monetary value and thereby in purchasing power.

Just how is it beneficial for their clients though? Is a proprietary token for home improvements a good initiative for emerging US startups like Renovaten, Next step living or Renoviso?

How does proprietary cryptocurrency benefit customers?

One of the key benefits of launching this new cryptocurrency is the simplification of transactions. Customers can buy more than 10 million products from the company, now paying instantly with a proprietary digital currency specifically developed for the home renovation and design trade.

Furthermore, the security aspect is not to be missed. The company’s blockchain protects the transaction itself as well as the shopping history of each client.

Tokenization as a breakthrough for entrepreneurs

Cryptocurrency has revolutionized the way business owners transact value, invest their savings and raise capital.

The blockchain technology offers highly impactful infrastructure for businesses to run their setups and build an entirely new business strategy in some highly trusted way without involving any centralized authority.

Even better, as nascent as the blockchain technology industry is, it offers a good opportunity to connect with the world’s famous entrepreneurs.

Businesses and individuals can transact value with the help of blockchain technology at much higher speed with very limited setup costs, and invest in high profile technology businesses in their startup phase.

The ease and cost efficiency of raising capital is a major reason; every home improvement startup should at least consider launching their own token.

Tokenization can boost startups in growing industries

According to research performed by Renovaten, the home remodeling expenses are expected to increase in the next coming years and may break the highs of ten years. The home improvement expenses in the US have already hit $304 billion this year.

Renovaten speculates new startups will continue to leverage blockchain technology to build their brands and offer the highest possible value to their customers and investors.

So, what do you think about this innovative method in the home improvement industry? Are you ready to adapt this evolution for your startup?

        <title><![CDATA[ Script Spotlight: A/D Levels ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ In this series we are picking and reviewing TradingView scripts for technical analysis that recently popped up in the daily popular feed. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ If you don’t have a TradingView account yet, make one here for free.

A/D Levels by ParCorn on TradingView



The A/D here stands for accumulation and distribution, but this particular indicator does not analyze trend at all.

It is simply looking for reversal candles on your timeframe. Once it finds a reversal candle, it draws a support line from its price level.

Full script code

The Script Breakdown

The script defines parameters for the candle - the size of the candle body and candle wick.

It then runs through the chart and finds the instances of candles with “bullish wick” and “bearish wick” which is the short-term reversal signal.

The size of the wick and candle body is relative to the true range.


  True Range of a day’s trading is the difference between the day’s high and low, extended with yesterday’s close if it lies outside today’s range.


There is also a second set of rules for 2-candle scissor reversal.

Both the 1-candle and 2-candle reversal is plotted the same way, as lines of accumulation and distribution starting from the reversal candle.

Last feature of the script is it colors the bar if the price crosses and closes over support or resistance.

Does it work?

The author himself does not comment on the use of the script but the featured timeframe on the script page is 5M. He uses the A/D Levels together with volume profile, session range and volume-weighted average price.

You will see the changed candle color better if you remove candle border color in your chart settings on TradingView.

In my charts, yellow bars indicate break through support and white bars break through resistance.

Scalping: 5M Chart

Here is the A/D Levels script on Bitfinex BTCUSD 5M as retrieved on Sep 29.



I found that it printed ridiculous amounts of supports and resistances over ranges.

At the first sight it looks confusing but once you are able to look more at the bigger picture and less at the individual lines, it does say a lot about levels of resistance and support.

You can always make the required wick ratio higher though, so that the script does not detect every little wick. The default value is 0.55 (55% of TR).

Higher Timeframes



For the 30M timeframe and made the criteria for acceptable wick ratio even higher.

It did made sense to me, even considering the repeated breaks through the support lines that quickly bounce back.

It is important to note though that the script only remembers the latest reversal candle in the time series. Above you see that in the action between 6350 and 6500 where the resistance stops dead in the air because there was another passing reversal candle found later. You will need to use some judgement when evaluating the chart.

On the 1D chart, it is quite useful when you keep the default settings (0.55, 0.25).

It does not print support on volatile days’ wicks because it compares with the true range. You can also see where support turns resistance:



Summary

A single candle does not provide enough information to really judge the market. For scalping, evaluating a candle close might often be a little late. Other than that it is easy to print candles on the short timeframe.

I would recommend it as a source of helpful information about that’s going on at the market but I would not trade it as actual support/resistance lines.

For short-term positions, TensorCharts’ heatmap and trades counter is more precise than the A/D Levels, it does not make much sense to resort primarily to candle shapes.

Nonetheless, I am surprised the indicator actually provides quite a good information once you play with it for a few minutes.

        <title><![CDATA[ The grim side of Bakkt's potential consequences ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ It seems all of the critics of Bakkt point to a single issue. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Last month, Bakkt was still firmly in the shadow of cryptocurrency ETF proposals. Come September everything changed and the current Bitcoin community agenda regarding Bakkt seems to be one hundred percent neon pristine positive.

It is always worth being careful about new projects, particularly ones with this overwhelmingly consistent response in a space like bitcoin markets and technology.

There should be some polarization in the community, it only shows there is development potential happening from bottom up.

Without disagreements, how can the blockchain space claim it is decentralized, and how different would the community be from a scripted TV debate or personalized Facebook agenda pushing?

The thirsty traders

As it appears now, the dire market conditions messed with the appetite for decentralized governance significantly.

In August 2018, freshmen cryptocurrency investors from late 2017 and early 2018 were getting exhausted by the prolonged downtrend in the fiat value of all cryptoassets.

While there is always a lot of silent people doing their thing as the bitcoin OTC volume estimates suggest, the public community voice was clear: There was a bubble after all, the correction has been long and exhausting, we need some fundamental positive news to justify a turning point.

In other words, We need someone who actually has money to invest, unlike us at this point, to start buying. Perhaps the ETF will do that?


  Fuck the ETF, sure it can help price but why isn’t the Bakkt Project by ICE (the guys who own the fkn New York Stock Exchange) being hyped? It’s way more bullish. Physically backed futures contracts. That means they must buy the actual BTC, not like the BS futures we have now that don’t require the underlying asset to trade. ICE will have to buy up a ton of BTC and store it. Increase in price and reduced circulating supply. Win-Win. / Reddit, August 2018


This is not the place for Satoshi visions and other memes, rather it is that the community response prompts a simple appeal to common sense:


  Are you really participating in a capital market and relying with your decision making judgement on the conventional public opinions?
  With this mindset, would you have ever bought a cryptocurrency at any point in time before the bulk of 2017’s gains became publicly acknowledged?


Who criticizes Bakkt

With the majority of the community being stoked about potential relief from the bear market, there is not a lot of criticism based on ideology this time. When someone already brings up a point against Bakkt, it tends to be very factual.

And there is every opportunity to do so, for anyone who is interested: Bakkt project has a landing page and a blog but as of end September 2018, the content of both is marketing speak exclusively. Facts or responses to questions are sparse and vague.

At this stage, even an airdrop that distributes for a mailing list sign up gets questioned harder.

Not your keys, not your Bitcoin

“An ETF is a multibillion-dollar ‘not-your-keys-not-your-Bitcoin’ vehicle. That is why I am against it,” Andreas Antonopoulos said to the Bitcoin ETF obsession - an argument that applies the same to the Bakkt’s cryptoasset custody offering.

According to Antonopoulos, the implication of this big a market for “second-tier investors” is the power over consensus gained by actors who are not personally interested in the state of the network because they do not hold their own private keys.

Recalling the 2017 Bitcoin Cash fork and many other Bitcoin forks that followed, the pivotal point for most of them was the decision of major cryptocurrency exchanges to either support or disregard the forked coin. With bigger institutional investors coming to the market, should the fork pattern repeat, they will be the majority.

Nick Szabo similarly argues at this point the legacy products “might cause more problems than it’s worth”, as quoted by Bitcoinist.

The correlation of price with Bitcoin network activity

The symbiont.io president and Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long was similarly concerned about how forks will be handled by Bakkt, a question that was raised but left without an answer from Bakkt.

Long also criticized the fact that client collateral will not be held segregated for each client but in a single account (“commingled”) and that it will employ fractional reserve backing practices (“rehypothecation”).

While Bakkt futures will not offer explicit leverage, the two practices mentioned will effectively enable clients to trade with more Bitcoin than there is.

That weakens Bakkt’s contribution to price discovery and removes a degree of transparency from Bitcoin trading.

At the current state of Bitcoin markets, price action is still very much correlated with network activity and cryptocurrency exchange positions data, both of which are easily accessible in real time. Due to the hidden leverage, Bakkt trading could potentially cause events that will be divorced from metrics observable by the retail trader.

The fresh opportunity

Right now though, it appears that the business of capital management needs cryptoassets one way or another.

Elon Musk recently tweeted that he is considering taking Tesla private at 420 USD. Whether it was meant seriously or not, it has drawn the attention to a bigger problem: Due to increasingly strict regulations, the number of publicly listed companies in the US has fallen steadily since 1997.

In fact, more companies have delisted than gone public in every year of the past 20 years except the single year of 2013.

One of the implications of this situation is the damaging effect it has on portfolio management. It simply becomes more difficult to build a diversified portfolio when you don’t have a diversity of stocks to choose from, to quote the US Global Investors report written by Frank Holmes on 10th August 2018.

The report identifies cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as a potential opportunity for investors who look to diversify.

The long-enough timeline?

It seems all of the critics of Bakkt point to a single issue: While it is laudable to pioneer a crypto custody service and to set the compliance standard for others, Bakkt’s own biggest edge seems to be in creating a silo of information about a market that, given the public trading conditions in the US, may later become crucial.

Even so, there are people who believe that ultimately Bakkt’s model will fail:

“A regulated exchange with a custodian may be popular for a short period of time, but it’s not the future. The future will be the original idea of a peer-to-peer network,” says Abhishek Punia, a cryptocurrency analyst at Draper Associates, one of the VC firms that are most active in the blockchain technology industry.

After all, silos are prone to conflicts of interest and the difference from legacy finance is rampant here: Nobody is a prisoner of the only available system; unless the Earth’s electricity gets completely shut down, anyone will always have a possibility to interact with blockchains in a non-custodial or even fully decentralized manner.

If the Bakkt hype is to be taken seriously though, no flight to decentralization is likely to happen before an impactful damaging incident.

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last month, Bakkt was still firmly in the shadow of cryptocurrency ETF proposals. Come September everything changed and the current Bitcoin community agenda regarding Bakkt seems to be one hundred percent neon pristine positive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always worth being careful about new projects, particularly ones with this overwhelmingly consistent response in a space like bitcoin markets and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There should be some polarization in the community, it only shows there is development potential happening from bottom up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without disagreements, how can the blockchain space claim it is decentralized, and how different would the community be from a scripted TV debate or personalized Facebook agenda pushing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-thirsty-traders&quot;&gt;The thirsty traders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it appears now, the dire market conditions messed with the appetite for decentralized governance significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2018, freshmen cryptocurrency investors from late 2017 and early 2018 were getting exhausted by the prolonged downtrend in the fiat value of all cryptoassets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is always a lot of silent people doing their thing as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1023667334660149248&quot;&gt;bitcoin OTC volume estimates suggest&lt;/a&gt;, the public community voice was clear: There was a bubble after all, the correction has been long and exhausting, we need some fundamental positive news to justify a turning point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;We need someone who actually has money to invest, unlike us at this point, to start buying. Perhaps the ETF will do that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fuck the ETF, sure it can help price but why isn’t the Bakkt Project by ICE (the guys who own the fkn New York Stock Exchange) being hyped? It’s way more bullish. Physically backed futures contracts. That means they must buy the actual BTC, not like the BS futures we have now that don’t require the underlying asset to trade. ICE will have to buy up a ton of BTC and store it. Increase in price and reduced circulating supply. Win-Win. / &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9837wb/andreas_antonopoulos_btc_etf_is_really_bad_news/e4dmnux/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=CryptoCurrency&quot;&gt;Reddit, August 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the place for Satoshi visions and other memes, rather it is that the community response prompts a simple appeal to common sense:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are you really participating in a capital market and relying with your decision making judgement on the conventional public opinions?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With this mindset, would you have ever bought a cryptocurrency at any point in time before the bulk of 2017’s gains became publicly acknowledged?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-criticizes-bakkt&quot;&gt;Who criticizes Bakkt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the majority of the community being stoked about potential relief from the bear market, there is not a lot of criticism based on ideology this time. When someone already brings up a point against Bakkt, it tends to be very factual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is every opportunity to do so, for anyone who is interested: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bakkt.com/index&quot;&gt;Bakkt project has a landing page and a blog&lt;/a&gt; but as of end September 2018, the content of both is marketing speak exclusively. Facts or responses to questions are sparse and vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, even an airdrop that distributes for a mailing list sign up gets questioned harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-your-keys-not-your-bitcoin&quot;&gt;Not your keys, not your Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An ETF is a multibillion-dollar ‘not-your-keys-not-your-Bitcoin’ vehicle. That is why I am against it,” Andreas Antonopoulos said to the Bitcoin ETF obsession - an argument that applies the same to the Bakkt’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/custody/&quot;&gt;cryptoasset custody&lt;/a&gt; offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Antonopoulos, the implication of this big a market for “second-tier investors” is the power over consensus gained by actors who are not personally interested in the state of the network because they do not hold their own private keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recalling the 2017 Bitcoin Cash fork and many other Bitcoin forks that followed, the pivotal point for most of them was the decision of major cryptocurrency exchanges to either support or disregard the forked coin. With bigger institutional investors coming to the market, should the fork pattern repeat, they will be the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Szabo similarly argues at this point the legacy products “might cause more problems than it’s worth”, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoinist.com/andreas-antonopoulos-criticizes-bitcoin-etfs/&quot;&gt;quoted by Bitcoinist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-correlation-of-price-with-bitcoin-network-activity&quot;&gt;The correlation of price with Bitcoin network activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symbiont.io president and Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1031565897167765505&quot;&gt;similarly concerned about how forks will be handled by Bakkt&lt;/a&gt;, a question that was raised but left without an answer from Bakkt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long also criticized the fact that client collateral will not be held segregated for each client but in a single account (“commingled”) and that it will employ fractional reserve backing practices (“rehypothecation”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read full commentary in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cryptoiscoming.com/what-will-bakkt-do-for-crypto/&quot;&gt;“What Will Bakkt Do For Crypto?” on CryptoIsComing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Bakkt futures will not offer explicit leverage, the two practices mentioned will effectively enable clients to trade with more Bitcoin than there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That weakens Bakkt’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/company/bakkt/&quot;&gt;contribution to price discovery&lt;/a&gt; and removes a degree of transparency from Bitcoin trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the current state of Bitcoin markets, price action is still very much correlated with network activity and cryptocurrency exchange positions data, both of which are easily accessible in real time. Due to the hidden leverage, Bakkt trading could potentially cause events that will be divorced from metrics observable by the retail trader.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Script Spotlight: Automatic Divergences ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ In this series we are picking scripts for technical analysis that recently popped up in the TradingView daily popular feed. ]]></description>

PPO Divergence Alerts (PPOD)

Full script

PPOD is a script that plots labels under or above candles where a divergence on PPO occurred.

PPO or Price Oscillator is a technical indicator very similar to MACD. It is calculated the same way as MACD but it presents the final value as a percentage.


  
    MACD takes the difference in values between those two Moving Averages and an EMA of those Moving Averages, then plots that difference between the two lines as a histogram.
  
  
    PPO does the same but it then calculates a percentage. This makes value comparisons simpler over longer durations of time.
  


The PPOD script is this PPO Divergence script only re-styled so that it will plot labels instead of a line indicator below the chart. It can be rewritten for use with other oscillators.

Parameters: (lookback period to look for divergences, PPO fast line, PPO slow line, PPO signal line, PPO smoothing)

Does it work?



This is the PPOD indicator on 1D chart of BTCUSD on Bitfinex using the default settings: (55,12,26,9,2).

Here the strongest signals are the red and pink labels that signify a bearish and bullish divergence on that timeframe. The red and green arrows show where the PPO was overbought and oversold - it is an oscillator which means you can use similar patterns as you would with MACD or RSI.

We can see on 1D the PPOD caught the 20k top although only after two other bearish div alerts at range tops. It also registers the current bottom.



On 4H you can see it registers the recent 8400 top couple of candles after the fact, but then it prints another divergence on the bounce which ended up being a pivotal point. That’s not bad.

If you are a scalper, you will run into problems on short timeframes and on the 1W chart the overbought/oversold fits better than the actual divergences:



In both cases it is important to remember what divergences actually show: If a divergence happens, there is a mismatch between the price and the buy or sell momentum. That strengthens the potential for a reversal but it is not itself a trigger to trade on that reversal. Whether you find a divergence or not does depend a lot on your settings, and I don’t think the same settings will necessarily be suitable for all market conditions.

Now specifically to shorter timeframes - If the volatility is high, there will always be divergences. They show the price is overshooting, nothing else. The only actionable information to take from that is “maybe I should become a market maker”, I think. It means nothing for trades that are meant to last longer than a couple of minutes.

Divergences are not useless for scalpers and daytraders though. One good strategy is to start the day looking at 4H to see what will most likely be the dominant direction of the session. Some days it is better to primarily focus on quick longs, some days on quick shorts.

In the most basic way you could simply plot an MA to see whether the price is above or below it. Divergences can be used in a similar way for confirmation.

Removing the Lines Is NOT An Advantage

There is one problem I have with line indicators reduced to simple alerts though: You do not get to see whether your indicator settings are not complete rubbish.

Say, you are a scalper and want to use PPO Divergence alerts on 5M chart. You will load the chart, find that the default settings don’t fit and you will start tweaking them.

Maybe you will find that settings with very low smoothing and big difference between the fast and slow lines work best, and you decide to go with that. The alert script keeps printing the alerts just the same but you don’t know there is more noise than signal unless you plot the actual underlying line indicator with your settings.

Plotting a single symbol works much better with events that do not have development. You can do it nicely with “rektlines”: Find singular events that will trigger most of the bots - something like an MA cross, an Ichimoku TK cross, MACD cross. Calculate 10% and 5% level against the position of the bot and you have a level where the bot positions on 10x and 20x leverage will get liquidated.

In this kind of case plotting a single symbol is completely fine but I would not use PPO Divergence alerts only without also using the line indicator.

Better Alternative: The Adaptive RSI Divergences

Full script



I can recommend using scripts that will paint the divergence along with the underlying indicator, though. Looking for divergences is a pain.

You can use the PPOD but I prefer this Adaptive Divergences script which plots the actual div lines.

Also, this particular script is an implementation of John Ehlers’ Adaptive RSI. The length value is not specified by user, it adopts according to the price development. The script looks for price cycles and bases the length values on them which gives less false signals. Do try this one.

Decentralized games are facing the same challenge as the rest of the dApp industry - declining user base. As reported by diar.co, even the most popular decentralized game CryptoKitties suffered a decline of 96% in terms of active users measured by unique active ETH addresses. The reason for poor user retention according to Diar is unintuitive multi-step user experience, a crucial issue that even in the future could make finding new adopters difficult.

An intuitive solution also highlighted by Andrew Gazdecki of Altcoin.io is sharing of liquidity: Blockchain projects should not silo their apps, they should instead engage in liquidity pooling and support collaboration among different blockchain assets.

The blockchain game Etheremon is the first decentralized gaming platform that made this step to make the dApp game more accessible and partnered with Kyber Network. The integration launched on Tuesday 18th September 2018 at noon UTC.

Leveraging Kyber Network in Blockchain Gaming

Kyber Network developed an on-chain liquidity protocol that allows decentralized token swaps to be integrated into any application.

Kyber Network supports atomic token swaps with immediate settlement, effectively removing transaction waiting time. With this integration value exchange can be performed seamlessly between all parties in the ecosystem.

While the one application that comes first in mind is decentralized trading, in the most general way Kyber Network makes it possible to use any ERC-20 token where a platform-specific token would otherwise be necessary.

In the world of game dApps where every game has its own in-game currency this is a substantial improvement in usability for users who play more than one blockchain game.  Kyber Network integration means they can access gaming dApps using any ERC-20 token, no need to hold and manage segregated in-game funds for each dApp game they play.

It is expected among the most popular tokens to use in Etheremon will be Zilliqa (ZIL) and Basic Attention Token (BAT).

Advantage in the Crowded Blockchain Gaming Industry

According to DappRadar.com, decentralized games are among the most popular dApps overall. CryptoKitties currently rank fourth and Etheremon fifth on the leaderboard of all dApps on the Ethereum blockchain.

As of September 2018 the total number of active dApp games is around 350. This demonstrates not only the soaring engagement with blockchain from the gaming community but also the increasing competitiveness of the blockchain gaming industry.

Making the game token management easier could quickly prove to be a strong advantage. With no need to exchange tokens, users are ready to play at any time they decide so. Thanks to Kyber’s atomic swaps with instant settlement there is no waiting time necessary as there would be with the traditional token exchange methods.

In the business of entertainment, it is risky to let the player’s interest wane in wait for transaction confirmation. And conversely: When deciding between several dApp games, we could see players prioritize the most accessible one.

        <title><![CDATA[ DEX Series, Episode 3: Andrew Gazdecki of Altcoin.io on the Community Approach and Future of DEX Trading ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ According to Andrew, the best path forward for blockchain advancements is through more open collaboration and less closed competition. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Altcoin.io is a DEX project powered by Plasma that was first announced earlier in 2018 and just completed their crowdfunding campaign through WeFunder, raising $950k USD from over 1100 investors.

Although the altcoin exchange is not operational yet, the platform has been open to sign-ups since its testnet launch. If you have not already, make your account at Altcoin.io to test the atomic swap wallet and the user interface.

The CEO and founder of Altcoin.io is Andrew Gazdecki kindly took the time to answer our questions about what’s new at Altcoin.io and the approach that makes this DEX project distinct from other cryptoasset trading platforms out there.



The atomic swap wallet at https://swap.altcoin.io:





In a recent blog post you announced the decision to open-source your atomic swap wallet. That is an unusual decision now that most blockchain tech projects are becoming protective of their assets, relying on private deals and so on. What was behind it?

Community approach is one of the core values of Altcoin.io and there is a reason for it, so the decision to open-source the atomic swap wallet was mostly strategic.

Clearly the crypto community has amazing power and blockchain industry is full of talented people, but I also think the best path forward for blockchain advancements is through more open collaboration and less closed competition.

This is the case especially when it comes to decentralized trading. After all we are all working on the same mission to create more secure cryptocurrency trading environments.

Is this a hint at the issue with getting initial liquidity that new cryptocurrency exchanges face?

That is one of the implications of closed competition. I believe the liquidity problem is partly self-inflicted because new trading platforms silo technology and customers to protect market share.

Quite generally in the cryptotrading industry, it is our combined talent and effort that is the key to unlocking a market that will be decentralized also in the practical sense of the word - truly liquid, not just “located on a DEX”. If we work together we can leverage each other’s strengths to overcome the toughest challenges as a community, creating a better market for everyone.

To facilitate this we are developing an SDK for pooled liquidity among multiple decentralized exchanges and dApps because sharing the liquidity is simply one of the easiest ways to solve this problem.



  Introducing the Altcoin.io Team

  The CEO and founder is Andrew Gazdecki who was also the founder of Bizness Apps, the number #91 on Inc. Magazine’s list of the 500 fastest-growing companies in 2015. Andrew lives in San Diego and travels back and forth between California and Bosnia where the Altcoin.io engineering team is based.

  Sule, or Sulejman Sarajlija, is the Altcoin.io CTO and lead developer. He specializes in back-end development and blockchain technologies. He leads Djenad, Anto, and Azra, who are the engineering team.

  Fabian Vogelsteller is one of the six technical advisors to Altcoin.io. Fabian’s worked on many open-source projects in the blockchain space, including Ethereum’s Mist browser and the Ethereum Wallet. He also proposed the ERC20 standard, ushering in a new era of token trading, and brings a wealth of technical expertise and insight to the team.

  Other than Fabian, the advisory board has crypto trading personalities such as Josh Olszewicz, Nick &quot;Pizpie&quot; Cote or Nate &quot;Coinrun&quot; Freire.



&amp;nbsp;

Altcoin.io is not the first platform with plans to pool the liquidity, though. How are you going to appeal to other DEXes and dApps to work with you?

First point is scalability. We first started out working with atomic swaps to address both trustless trading and blockchain interoperability and we had some success with that. But in the end atomic swaps fail to provide the great user experience we aim for - transactions take minutes to confirm and fees can get high.

The crypto trading community wants security but not at all costs, which is why we have completely moved away from atomic swap research and are building a Plasma-based DEX instead.


  “Why we’ve chosen a Plasma-like sidechain solution for our DEX” at blog.altcoin.io


Apart from our focus on scalability, what makes Altcoin.io different is user experience. That is an often neglected aspect in decentralized trading.

Currently all decentralized exchanges suffer from unintuitive, slow, multi-step user experiences which leads to low user adoption and low daily trading volume. Especially newer traders are not going to trade on your platform if the learning curve is steep and the process of submitting an order complicated.

It is already starting to show - as Diar.co reported recently, all dApps have been losing their user base at a rapid rate. I believe user experience plays a role in that.


  “Decentralized Apps Facing Half-Life After Peak” at diar.co


The goal of Altcoin.io is to be the first DEX that can truly compete with centralized exchanges and we know exactly what it takes as four of our six technical advisors are active cryptocurrency traders.

So we are very aware that in order to compete we need intuitive, user-friendly platform not only in terms of trading interface. Even the SDK we are launching is a complete out-of-the box solution. You can launch your own DEX without being a developer.

An onboarding path from fiat to crypto is surely part of the package to compete with centralized platforms. In August 2018, Altcoin.io partnered with SendWyre while DEXes are typically choosing to directly implement a stablecoin. Why SendWyre?

The main point here is to reduce friction for both new and experienced users.

Crypto trading old-timers may be comfortable with scenarios like buying a cryptocurrency directly, storing it anonymously and hedging its value in some way to capture the market movements, but people who are new to cryptocurrency trading are interested in different kind of products.

SendWyre is a regulated service that provides a fiat to crypto on-boarding path. They verify that you are who you say you are, mint an ERC-721 non-fungible token for you and after this one-time process you are free to start trading with compliant liquidity on a DEX.


  “Community Driven On-Chain Compliance” at blog.sendwyre.com


MakerDAO who is the creator of Dai stablecoin has partnered with SendWyre as well which means we will be working with both.

We are definitely not avoiding working with stablecoins, if it seemed like that. Partnering with SendWyre was just the most efficient way to open up our exchange to those who may be entering cryptocurrency for the very first time, which is huge.

In terms of potential collaboration with Altcoin.io, what other blockchain technology projects are you watching?

Not exactly in terms of partnership opportunity but we’re huge fans of Tendermint and the Raiden Network.

I think blockchain scalability is one of the most important issues to be working on right now. Without scalable solutions, mass user adoption will not happen no matter how good the blockchain applications get.

        <title><![CDATA[ How Blockchain Disrupts The Legal Industry: A Primer ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Smart contracts, digital testaments and even marketplaces to trade whole discontinued startups are here. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Everything from smart contracts to the chain of custody, blockchain technology revolutionizes much of the legal industry.

At the heart of the disruption there is the blockchain, a way to create an immutable and transparent shared ledger where you can store shared information.

Law As A High-Tech Industry

You hardly think of the legal sector as a high-tech industry. Lawyers still deal with stacks of papers and much of the legal industry is called paper chase.

Blockchain technology can disrupt precisely this paper-heavy aspect of the law practice.

Smart Contracts For Law

Even today, legal contracts still involve the use of a physical piece of paper where they are written up and signed.

It requires a fair amount of time to draw up a legally binding agreement because of the number of people who need to physically meet.

Blockchain technology could change this because of how it will turn this into a digital process known as Smart Contracts. Lawyers won’t need to get as involved when you generate contracts through a trustless digital process between the relevant parties.

Through blockchain technology, the friction and cost of a legally binding document will be lowered.

In addition, blockchain provides you with the storage of the agreement, and you don’t have the requirement for the intermediaries.

Because lawyers could be eliminated from the process altogether, this technology will likely interfere with the legal profession but ultimately, lawyers will not disappear. They will be required to know how to review the logic of smart contracts instead.

Most lawyers probably first heard about cryptoassets when the anonymous or pseudonymous nature of some of them encouraged criminals to use them, with legal startups on the blockchain there is now another use-case opening up.

No matter how you look at it as cryptocurrency goes mainstream, lawyers will have the need to understand how cryptocurrencies work even before they will make use of them for document storage or transactions.

Intellectual Property

Legally speaking, protecting intellectual property has always been a challenge.

But through blockchain technology, companies have a new way to register their intellectual property in a way that will anchor it to a blockchain which is immutable.

The end result of blockchain technology for intellectual property is how you have a system that will prove twice as hard to corrupt. Blockchains get held in servers from all over the world, and a big advantage of them is their programmability.

You always have a high level of automation with blockchain.

In the same way, this will make the trading of intellectual property belonging to different companies much easier, and it will diminish the lawyer expenses. That is important for smaller players who have less than infinite funding.

There are already blockchain tech companies such as Lexit that work on this particular solution: A decentralized marketplace to do mergers &amp;amp; acquisitions on the blockchain, re-selling proprietary technology of a startup or even the trading of whole startups that have been discontinued.

Mergers &amp;amp; acquisitions are becoming important in the nascent blockchain space now that the ICO hype has worn off and it is no longer as easy to raise funds as it was in 2017.

The lack of funding has its consequences: While large corporations have the funds they tend to stay away from disruptive technologies because they are unproven and risky.

Small startups are the disruptors but they lack the resources to scale, market themselves and pay legal fees to stay compliant.

That is why many startups get bought by a large company once they have raked up a solid user base. The corporation can see the new technology has potential and invests to stay at the top of the industry, the startup does not need to solve the problem of competing with a a business that has far larger resources.

Tracking Property Transaction

How property gets sold, bought and rented for now means visiting your local government property office, and you can tell this industry remains in the last century. Piles of paper deeds, ledgers and property cards; all of this to track the ownership of property.

When the system goes digital, however, the immutable database will keep everything organized with much less back office effort; and that not only in property trade data but also for instance in legal documents needed in court cases.

That is at least true about the Western world.

The problem in the developing world is the general lack of infrastructure. Protecting individual property rights is more difficult and disputes arise often, human lawyers are required.

Considering how some of India’s land records, for example, stretch back to the colonial ages, the blockchain should offer everyone far more security through the digital storing of these documents, but there is still a long way to go.

India was still the most appropriate country to host the international conference of Blockchain Property Governance in 2017, which addressed some of the issues that people face with property rights.

Store and Secure Legal Documents

Just like with trading of intellectual property, any other kind of transaction can be recorded in a transparent immutable way on a blockchain.

The immutability of blockchain is an advantage here as it diminishes the risk of tampering compared to traditional storage of digital data. At the same time, documents can still be labeled and categorized as easily as in any other digital storage, which means even older data can be easily retrieved and reused when needed.


  
    The decentralized blockchain KYC/AML platforms such as Civic, Sefkey and Traceto.io make use of the secure and easy cataloging feature of blockchain to store personal identities.
  
  
    Blocknotary seeks to use this technology for fingerprinting for media files. It eliminates the need of a rubber stamp that the notary public still uses today.
  
  
    Will Testament and similar projects have cropped up to deal with testaments on the blockchain, a pressing issue in times when early crypto adopters have large sums stored outside of bank accounts or other properties linked with their citizen identity.
  


The legal implementations of blockchain are still in an very early experimental phase. It is still a use case worth watching to see what kind of changes will be coming to the legal industry and which of the emerging blockchain tech companies in the space will make a breakthrough.

        <title><![CDATA[ SEC - Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities; market rebounds ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Quick debrief on some other topics that emerged as the SEC ruled BTC and ETH not a security. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Bitcoin has been making gains over the past several hours, rebounding from the 6350 USD mark to a daily high over 6700 USD.

The leap off the bottom happened just after the news report published via the CNBC.

The #cryptomarkets like to see the SEC news! #crypto $ETH pic.twitter.com/9OgieEeTTe&amp;mdash; News AltcoinTrading.NET (@altcointrading_) June 14, 2018


Below quick debrief on some other topics that emerged as the rebound started happening:

Is EOS a security?

EOS is a cryptocurrency popular mainly in Asia that has earned a substantial amount of money through and only recently launched its own blockchain.

Blockchain enthusiasts seem to agree that as EOS is already done with its crowd fund it should not be a security, just as Ethereum is now officially not a security.

Will all cryptocurrencies be judged individually?

As Peter Van Valkenburgh of Coin Center explained live on Bloomberg TV on June 14 2018, in most cases it will be possible to go by analogy.

The SEC commented Bitcoin and Ethereum in particular, the two cryptocurrencies that represent well the two kinds of tokens that make the majority of the crypto markets - cryptocurrencies meant for payments and cryptocurrencies as app tokens.

This should also prove valid for the question of EOS above, just saying “it is meant to be treated like ETH” is not good enough though.

Utility Tokens?

Calling a cryptocurrency a ‘utility token’ does not mean it cannot be a security.

What is important for the SEC is the actual usage rather than the label assigned to it in the whitepaper. What is judged here is how decentralized the network is, whether there is investor assymetry to be addressed, how is the token being used on the platform.

This is not a new thing either, SEC merely confirmed the common sense

The crypto trading community is indeed coming back to the good humor it is known for:
