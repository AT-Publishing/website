        <title>How the legacy finance might be feeling about cryptocurrencies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the people who have invested in cryptocurrencies in the past years were not professional investors. And a big chunk of those who went into altcoin trading might not have been rich before they hodl‚Äôd Ethereum since it was $9 ‚Äì or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day when Ethereum didn‚Äôt exist yet there were running jokes in Bitcoin forums about one day getting as rich as to be able to bribe senators. Well, these days nobody jokes about things like that anymore. By now the people from two three years back are probably just getting closer to where the target audience of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mauldineconomics.com/&quot;&gt;Mauldin Economics&lt;/a&gt; is: people who have earned some, yet aren‚Äôt the ones who move the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are excerpts taken from a today‚Äôs newsletter on Mauldin Economics. The letter does not even mention let alone endorse cryptocurrencies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrF6Wz61HE&quot;&gt;although the autors have in the past&lt;/a&gt;), but it is an interesting insight into the minds of a lot people who on Reddit would be called &lt;em&gt;normies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, no matter how zerohedge ‚Äúevery day is a doomsday‚Äù it sounds, these people might be starting to worry about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-05-11/what-will-global-economy-look-after-great-reset&quot;&gt;Great Reset&lt;/a&gt;, the re-evaluation of the markets. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/djUcU&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; seems to be targeting people who have good income and reinvest the extra money so that it doesn‚Äôt lie around losing value. That means, a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need [‚Ä¶] to restructure our portfolios to make sure we get as much of our wealth as we possibly can to the ‚Äúother side‚Äù of the coming crisis [‚Ä¶] We just have to get there with our assets intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/djUcU&quot;&gt;full thing&lt;/a&gt; you‚Äôll learn why the debt-economy could collapse and all the rest of it in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the newsletter is primarily a pitch and the main point consist mainly of the modern portfolio theory getting beaten. If there is a truly global crisis ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe that diversifying among asset classes will simply diversify your losses during the next global recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think the answer lies in diversifying among noncorrelated &lt;em&gt;trading strategies&lt;/em&gt; that can invest in any asset class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ And that‚Äôs about it, with one little detail - it‚Äôs focused on ETFs. Diverse ETF trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You know how somebody will talk about getting a time-consuming task done and then the next person says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an app for that‚Äù? No matter what asset you want, there‚Äôs now an ETF for that. I am constantly amazed how narrowly focused ETFs can be. There is now an ETF that focuses its investments just on companies in the ETF industry. It‚Äôs not all large-cap-index ETFs anymore. &lt;strong&gt;Some really small, niche-market ETFs have attracted significant capital.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting is how they particularly consider the niche ETFs. It almost sounds like they‚Äôd take any ETF, and perhaps the more outlandish the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems that in case there were a cryptocurrency ETF, there would be plenty of buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A &quot;This Is Gentlemen&quot; Moment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Something sober to thin down the moonjuice before the weekend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ethereum-past-100&quot;&gt;Ethereum past $100&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;r/ethtrader&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not liking this whole ‚ÄúBitcoin to the Moon on devasted fundamentals,‚Äù thing we got going on right now. Having to resist the fomo.
I certainly hope those off chain scaling fanatics drop the price if BTC forks,I don‚Äôt want to be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;reddit-embed&quot; data-embed-media=&quot;www.redditmedia.com&quot; data-embed-parent=&quot;false&quot; data-embed-live=&quot;false&quot; data-embed-uuid=&quot;ba94139b-7ccb-4cc3-93bc-42da8a30efa1&quot; data-embed-created=&quot;2017-05-19T12:12:38.822Z&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6c0opi/we_hit_100_mirin_my_btc_hodlings/dhrcy8s/&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; from discussion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6c0opi/we_hit_100_mirin_my_btc_hodlings/&quot;&gt;We hit $100!! &amp;#x27;Mirin my BTC hodlings? üòú&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What caused the jump?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;could be ripple pump earlier this week is selling off into ETH + big announcements coming up next week.
but the real answer is no one really knows except more buyers than sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;reddit-embed&quot; data-embed-media=&quot;www.redditmedia.com&quot; data-embed-parent=&quot;false&quot; data-embed-live=&quot;false&quot; data-embed-uuid=&quot;0fbdf20c-6593-469c-a796-129e21884251&quot; data-embed-created=&quot;2017-05-19T12:14:01.121Z&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6c0opi/we_hit_100_mirin_my_btc_hodlings/dhr5ms4/&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; from discussion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6c0opi/we_hit_100_mirin_my_btc_hodlings/&quot;&gt;We hit $100!! &amp;#x27;Mirin my BTC hodlings? üòú&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/Ethereum/&quot;&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; posters remain quite conservative, expecting mostly $200 or $300 ETH by the end of 2017, although $500 can be seen too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bitcoin-hitting-2000-on-bitfinex&quot;&gt;Bitcoin hitting $2000 on Bitfinex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;r/bitcoinmarkets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;u/Merlin560: &lt;strong&gt;Point and Figure Update&lt;/strong&gt;
It did not take long to hit our first price target at $1,940. And now we are at the &lt;strong&gt;Long Pole&lt;/strong&gt;.
The price looks like it just keeps getting stronger. The Alts continue move up as well. Is this because the Japanese are going nuts? Is it because there are bad bongos coming out of China? Or is it just ‚Äúgrowth.‚Äù
Anyone telling you definitively what is driving this will be lying to you.
For now the pole grows higher. If it turns quickly expect to see lows around $1,800. Obviously, that is not the end of the world.
But, I am going to sit back and enjoy this. It was payday today‚Ä¶and I made more on paper before six AM this morning that I got paid last week. Not a bad place to me.
Enjoy it while its going up.
PS: Happy Birthday to my daughter!

&lt;p&gt;For those who don‚Äôt know, a ‚Äúlong pole‚Äù warning means a correction is due. However, in bubbles these corrections sometimes don‚Äôt come ‚Äì the worse is then the burst.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Monero mining malware</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a few days after the WannaCry mass ransomware a Monero mining malware has been reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix clearfix adfix&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-ad layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;728px&quot; height=&quot;90px&quot; type=&quot;adsense&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-6979812205705127&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4445157690&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-ad&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After WannaCry, UIWIX Ransomware and Monero-Mining Malware Follow Suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WannaCry ransomware‚Äôs outbreak during the weekend was mitigated by having its kill switch domain registered. It was only a matter of time, however, for other cybercriminals to follow suit. Case in point: the emergence of UIWIX ransomware (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_UIWIX.A) and one notable Trojan our sensors detected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from WannaCry and UIWIX, our sensors also detected a Trojan delivered using EternalBlue‚ÄîAdylkuzz (TROJ_COINMINER.WN). This malware turns infected systems into zombies and steals its resources in order to mine for the cryptocurrency Monero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/wannacry-uiwix-ransomware-monero-mining-malware-follow-suit/&quot;&gt;Read the full report.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Peerplays crowdfund ends in 3 days</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the current stage the PPY tokens cost $5.20 each, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/ico-regulations&quot;&gt;ICO - sorry, the crowdfund&lt;/a&gt; - ends in three days at 15:00 UTC on 14 May 2017, the PPY tokens will be distributed to participants on 30 May 2017. You can invest BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE, BitShares and &lt;a href=&quot;http://prntscr.com/f6pdj3&quot;&gt;couple other coins to participate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peerplays.com/crowdfund/&quot;&gt;https://www.peerplays.com/crowdfund/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-peerplays&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs Peerplays&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peerplays aim to work as a betting platform. Because it‚Äôs on the blockchain, it will be available from all countries. Users place a bet, the bet is processed on the blockchain (it‚Äôs a dapp), profits are distributed via PPY - the Peerplays profit sharing tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting concept, except the red flag that comes with everything that is &lt;em&gt;the UBER of [industry]&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúPeerplays will eliminate the need for traditional bookies in their sports betting.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is this problem with people who keep coming back to estabilished bookies because everyone keeps coming back to estabilished bookies. Peerplays would require people to trust a dapp and it would require them to work with a dapp, that‚Äôs two very new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But who knows. The Bookie app that should enable betting is not going to be out before November 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However unlikely, maybe it will be sports betting made simple, and maybe the network effect will not play out because that‚Äôs a more substantial thing with poker rooms and trading platforms - places where you need other people to come by otherwise the experience sucks. Sports betting is something you do on your own, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, this is what everyone likes to hear preferentially these days: &lt;strong&gt;Peerplays is a divident paying token&lt;/strong&gt;. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peerplays Makes HODLing Profitable with Automatic Fee-Sharing Distributions: ‚ÄúPeerplays is aiming to be the first truly Decentralized Autonomous Cooperative (DAC) [...] With this new profit sharing module, all the &lt;strong&gt;fees that Peerplays charges&lt;/strong&gt; for smart contract operations and peer-to-peer wagering will be &lt;strong&gt;distributed directly to the holders of the core Peerplays blockchain tokens&lt;/strong&gt;, just like a traditional co-op pays &lt;strong&gt;dividends to its shareholders&lt;/strong&gt;.‚Äù &lt;a href=&quot;https://steemit.com/peerplays/@cryptoprometheus/peerplays-makes-hodling-profitable-with-automatic-fee-sharing-distributions&quot;&gt;- via steem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICO:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is the end of ICOs approaching?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/ico-2016/&quot;&gt;the last post on ICOs&lt;/a&gt; in summer 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lawmakers-have-noticed&quot;&gt;Lawmakers have noticed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a post on 2nd May 2017 at law111 and elsewhere that caught the attention of the crypto community. To be honest, it was an interesting thing for some die hard bitcoiners since they started projecting the EndOfEtherium‚Ñ¢ - the ICOs will get regulated, there will be no reason to buy ETH anymore, ETH will collapse and BTC will get it‚Äôs market cap share back. It is a bit too far out there, nonetheless there seem to be regulations in the making. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law111.com/11state-lawmakers-increasing-their-focus-on-vc-and-blockchain-technology&quot;&gt;post on law111&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In early 2017, multiple state legislatures have taken action reflecting their recognition of the potential impact of virtual currency and blockchain technology. These actions have ranged from requests for further information regarding the technology to an active debate regarding a specific use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶continuing with a state-by-state US legislations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a more human readable form, this was discussed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2017/03/96598-initial-coin-offering-probably-regulated-securities-law/&quot;&gt;crowdfundinginsider.com&lt;/a&gt; in March already:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For those of you not familiar with what ICOs are, here‚Äôs a quick summary. Lots of folks working in the blockchain world needed money to fund their project or startup. So they decided to invent their own ‚Äúcoin‚Äù variant and sold those coins to fund their project/startup, in exchange for some financial upside in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? That‚Äôs because it is. This is the story of every capital-hungry startup/business/entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve heard ICOs described as a ‚Äúdonation with financial upside‚Äù or ‚Äúcrowdsale‚Äù (whatever that is), and a number of other things‚Äîto try to avoid securities laws. First of all, a donation is a donation‚Äî you‚Äôre giving away money (or bitcoin), and there is no financial upside to a donation. A ‚Äúcrowdsale‚Äù of tokens‚Äîto the extent those ‚Äútokens‚Äù represent securities‚Äîis still a security. There are a number of different things that ICOs are doing, so it‚Äôs difficult to address the entire industry in one article, but let me impart some guidance to make this easier to understand: If walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, its probably a duck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eric-voorhees-was-the-first-to-test-the-waters&quot;&gt;Eric Voorhees was the first to test the waters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penalty for such offense is a fine and restriction for the person that was the head of the enterprise - typically they cannot serve as a chief executive of any company again, or they cannot raise capital again. This is supposed to mean the end of the person‚Äôs career although apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2014/33-9592.pdf&quot;&gt;Eric Voorhees is still around and doing well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;June 3, 2014, via SEC.gov/litigation ‚Äì Respondent has undertaken to: Forgo directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, through any entity owned or controlled by Respondent, participating in any issuance of any security in an unregistered
transaction, in exchange for bitcoins or other virtual currency, for a period of five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His later crypto-focused company that he founded, ShapeShift, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shapeshift#/entity&quot;&gt;had normal funding rounds&lt;/a&gt; like your usual startup would have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-regulation-actually-for&quot;&gt;What is the regulation actually for?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it is supposed to be a way to check the entrepreneur, in theory it should reduce the amount of scam artists in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing, however, it is safe to say it will take the regulators a while to figure out how to deal with the very new thing an ICO is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is, many people who had done ICOs before are certainly safe. There is several hundreds of crypto tokens by now. Some of them were funded by pseudonymous identities. In some cases the project that was backing them doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Nobody will ever know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait‚Ä¶is there a way this could possibly be done in the future as well? Could this actually mean the scams will not go away, not even with the regulation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-icos-in-2017&quot;&gt;New ICOs in 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Draper has been ‚Äúthe person in the news‚Äù this week when he announced his participation in Tezos token ICO. Some people even said, &lt;em&gt;this might be the last ICO before regulations so I might just invest&lt;/em&gt;. That‚Äôs totally a ‚Ä¶ reason /s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pehub.com/2017/05/investor-tim-draper-to-participate-in-blockchain-token-sale-for-first-time-reuters/#&quot;&gt;Via Reuters News:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Draper, an early supporter of bitcoin and its underlying blockchain financial ledger technology, told Reuters in an interview he will for the first time participate in a so-called ‚Äúinitial coin offering‚Äù (ICO) of Tezos slated later [in May 2017].
‚ÄúThe best thing I can do is lead by example,‚Äù said Draper, on his plan to participate in Tezos‚Äô token offering. ‚ÄúOver time, I actually feel that some of these tokens are going to improve the world, and I want to make sure those tokens get promoted as well. I think Tezos is one of those tokens.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With someone so influential backing a token, this could likely be a self fulfulling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tezos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tezos is a self-governing technology running with proof of stake. All upgrades and changes can be done automatically, without forking and without political infights. There should also be incentive for making the inovation on the Tezos ledger rather than forking off an appcoin. The Tezor creators argue the appcoins dilute the value of the parent coin rather than contribute to the network effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your usual popular ICO 2017 resources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1216757095051232/&quot;&gt;Facebook Group&lt;/a&gt; - closed group, login and ask for membership. The group is not very active, mostly just people posting announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icocountdown.com/&quot;&gt;ICO Countdown&lt;/a&gt; - the only site that has been featured here in 2016 and stays top.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://icoindex.com/&quot;&gt;Icoindex.com&lt;/a&gt;and their Slack channel - &lt;a href=&quot;https://icoindex-official.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;invite&lt;/a&gt;¬†- they are also on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ICOindex/&quot;&gt;facebook and are not getting very good&lt;/a&gt; reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-still-have-to-make-your-own-decision&quot;&gt;You still have to make your own decision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the idea, the team, the marketing, the roadmap and last but not least the token. The price, the allocation (how much will the developers have?) and inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market cap thing is flawed, there is a good in-depth article about that on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.sia.tech/want-to-deflate-the-token-bubble-fix-the-market-cap-indicator-d50f7f1e1ec4&quot;&gt;blog.sia.tech&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Take Zcash for example. It has a current market cap of $110 million with a total supply of 1.2 million ZEC, but over the next five years 9.8 million ZEC will enter existence. This super-high inflation will drastically increase supply each year, which in turn will affect the market cap. There is no way, however, for the average investor to quickly discover this inflation factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recommend adding a new metric called inflation factor that indicates how the market cap could be affected over the next five years by token inflation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inflation factor = (new supply over 5 years) / (current total supply) * 100%.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inflation factors calculated for the top 15 tokens &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*goypbtaXje1QRL7KGoAK4g.png&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see that only by making economically sound decision rather than spreading your money randomly across all ICOs will shrink the amount of feasible ICOs a lot. But indeed, reason is never enough to stop the bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Wtf is Gnosis?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix clearfix adfix&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-ad layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;728px&quot; height=&quot;90px&quot; type=&quot;adsense&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-6979812205705127&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4445157690&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-ad&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Poloniex announced on their website they will list Gnosis token one week after the end of the auction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Gnosis GNO tokens will be available
for trading on Poloniex one week
after the close of the auction.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Gnosis &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GNO&amp;amp;src=ctag&quot;&gt;$GNO&lt;/a&gt; tokens will be available for trading on Poloniex one week after the close of the auction. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/GlwkoAO1UE&quot;&gt;https://t.co/GlwkoAO1UE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/856570173112942593&quot;&gt;24 April 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came shortly after the controversial &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1876467.0&quot;&gt;delisting of 17 coins&lt;/a&gt;. Some traders were even talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/668gim/poloniex_delisting_some_apparently_good_coins_on/&quot;&gt;broken trust&lt;/a&gt; and moving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/668gim/poloniex_delisting_some_apparently_good_coins_on/dgglcbv/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=CryptoMarkets&quot;&gt;coins to bittrex&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway. Apparently the time has come to have fun on new and totally different altcoin markets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-gnosis-for&quot;&gt;What is Gnosis for&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a prediction multi-market where you can create your own markets for events if you have WIZ tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You get WIZ tokens in exchange for your Gnosis tokens if you decide to lock them in a smart contract for some period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You get Gnosis tokens for ETH, Gnosis runs on Ethereum.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The token model is not implemented yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auction is over by now and people who bought the Gnosis tokens will receive them right before the trading will start at Polo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.gnosis.pm/what-are-gnosis-tokens-the-new-access-based-token-model-e59c5a490af6&quot;&gt;blog.gnosis.pm/what-are-gnosis‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-it-would-make-crypto-traders-rage&quot;&gt;Why it would make crypto traders rage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶if they still had emotions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The Gnosis token sale ended at a theoretical 312.5 Million valuation.
2) Only 4.17 % of all tokens have been distributed to you early investors, the other 95.83 % of the tokens is in hands of the Gnosis team.
3) The Gnosis team now owns 299 million USD in artificial token value. They‚Äôve invested 0 USD.
4) In contrast, the investors who paid 100 % of the money, invested and own 13 million USD in tokens.
5) Let me be more clear: You paid 31.25 USD per Gnosis token and as a collective, have only received 4.17 % of all tokens.
6) Now take a seat before you read number 7
7) The actual value of the Gnosis tokens is 13 million USD (this is all of the actual money brought in by the investors) divided by 10 million tokens. That means each individual token now has a factual value of 1.3 USD.
8) As of now, your net result on your investment is -95 %
9) We did warn you: http://i.imgur.com/WAVLXWE.png - You triggered the worst case scenario in this graph
10) And warned by /r/ethtrader
11) But you just didn‚Äôt want to listen, did you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/67ax24/to_all_gnosis_token_holders_take_a_seat_before/&quot;&gt;r/ethtrader/comments/67ax‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-media&quot;&gt;The media&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obligatory-what-does-forbes-say&quot;&gt;Obligatory, what does Forbes say?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/04/24/gnosis-prediction-market-scores-12-5m-in-record-breaking-crypto-auction/#1aa4f80ae87d&quot;&gt;forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/04/24/‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gnosis, a decentralized platform for prediction markets that uses ‚Äúcrowdsourced wisdom‚Äù sourced globally and built on Ethereum technology, has set a new record by raising $12.5 million (m) in a token offering via a Dutch auction, the first successful one of its kind in crypto, and the fastest crowdsale to date to sell out more than $10m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;so-what-do-people-say&quot;&gt;So what do people say?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starting at over $300mill market cap?  Dump city (-90%)  RIP ICO investors.&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/3ideRaven/status/856570546204663809&quot;&gt;twitter, @3ideRaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So you are listing a coin where the devs own 95% of the total supply with more ICOS coming? Just wow‚Ä¶&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GetYourBounty/status/856614171768750082&quot;&gt;twitter, @GetYourBounty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember though, it‚Äôs not an obvious short either - it‚Äôs the same as DASH where the empire can move the price as needed because they have their precious instamine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Opinion: Time in the market vs timing the market</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/img/editorial/likeaboss.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/img/editorial/likeaboss.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: In the long run, time in the market beats timing the market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix clearfix adfix&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-ad layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;728px&quot; height=&quot;90px&quot; type=&quot;adsense&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-6979812205705127&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4445157690&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-ad&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the difference between trading and investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you trade&lt;/strong&gt; you don‚Äôt care which way the market goes as long as your position is making you money. All you need is to be right about the direction. For what it‚Äôs worth, even if you hold a shitcoin with absolutely no future and it pumps, you are making money - not that it wouldn‚Äôt resemble casino though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you invest&lt;/strong&gt; you are looking for value and you put in money that you realistically won‚Äôt need even in a few years time. You go for value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;which-one-is-more-profitable&quot;&gt;Which one is more profitable?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say that in the long run, time in the market beats timing the market. With the short term direction you cannot know for sure - even technical and fundamental analysis together with Reddit sentiment can only give you what‚Äôs likely, not what‚Äôs hundred percent sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically you have higher chance to be wrong in timing the market than you have when carefully picking an asset which you think has a long term chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time in the market is so much more important for an investor‚Äôs long-term returns than timing the market. This is something The Motley Fool takes to heart, because no one can accurately know when to get in and get out.  [‚Ä¶] ‚ÄúGenerally that tends to be true. But, alas, there are no firm rules here, and context is king in pretty much all of this. For example, there are times where valuations get super lofty.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; - via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/01/time-in-the-market-vs-timing-the-market.aspx&quot;&gt;The Motley Fool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hodlers-hate&quot;&gt;Hodlers Hate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days everyone hates the hodler cult in both BTC and ETH. The truth is though, as a hodler who is in a position for the long run, your biggest risk really is &lt;em&gt;losing your position&lt;/em&gt;. And the best way to lose it is to try and sell high to rebuy lower. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/litecoin-pump/#the-technicals&quot;&gt;In a bull market, the low won‚Äôt be so low.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how should you look at an asset if you want to hold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investors look at the following characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/ Real-World Adoption‚Ñ¢ - That‚Äôs why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/zoe-ethereum-alphabay/&quot;&gt;Ethereum on Alphabay&lt;/a&gt; is bigger a deal than &lt;a href=&quot;http://raiden.network/&quot;&gt;Raiden network&lt;/a&gt; or dapps even though both of the latter features are really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;a href=&quot;https://etherscan.io/chart/tx/&quot;&gt;Transactions per day&lt;/a&gt; which is related to adoption, and &lt;a href=&quot;/eth-traders-tool/&quot;&gt;other network data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;a href=&quot;http://coinmarketcap.com/&quot;&gt;Exchange volume per day&lt;/a&gt; and (anti)correlation with bitcoin to see how much of the use is just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course all cryptocurrency is still very young though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix clearfix adfix&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-ad layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;728px&quot; height=&quot;90px&quot; type=&quot;adsense&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-6979812205705127&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4445157690&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-ad&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-unlikely-altcoin-fundamental&quot;&gt;An unlikely altcoin fundamental&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/img/editorial/fuck.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/img/editorial/fuck.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would happen if Ethereum lost Vitalik? Something quite explicit for sure, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúGo for a business that any idiot can run - because sooner or later, an idiot probably is going to run it.‚Äù - Peter Lynch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this is a drawback of Ethereum as an investment asset. That &lt;strong&gt;doesn‚Äôt mean ETH wasn‚Äôt an outstanding trading opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; just recently - but that‚Äôs precisely the difference between trading and investment. For the &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; long term, it‚Äôs a question how sustainable this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, compare it to other popular altcoins on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure there are people who believe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/61atcg/what_i_believe_is_holding_back_our_adoption_and/&quot;&gt;certain coins&lt;/a&gt; are lead by idiots at present already, while other coins are &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/notgrubles/status/851878073909862400/photo/1&quot;&gt;quickly&lt;/a&gt; getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://cointimes.tech/2017/04/napoleonbitcoin/&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You shouldn‚Äôt blame people for holding on to assets with slower development and moronic leads. After all &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect&quot;&gt;the longer the assets are surviving this misfortune the more valuable they are for the long run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Litecoin: This time it's different?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Wait is this up or down?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix clearfix adfix&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-ad layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;728px&quot; height=&quot;90px&quot; type=&quot;adsense&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-6979812205705127&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4445157690&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-ad&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-rock&quot;&gt;The Rock&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arthur Hayes of BitMEX made his prognosis in the last issue of their newsletter - &lt;a href=&quot;http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=db45c09bdf20e1866bb32123f&amp;amp;id=256c134334&quot;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;, scroll down to &lt;em&gt;The Rock Is In The Building&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Litecoin has acted like a rock in trader‚Äôs bags since it hit its all time high of $40 in 2013. The technical merits of why Litecoin should be worth more than $0 are few and far between. Litecoin exists on life support only because Chinese traders for some reason enjoy trading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litecoin is some form of legacy. A BTC spinoff dangerously close to bitcoin only with the advantage of faster transactions, it is easy to implement for an exchange that already does BTC. The reason most people who aren‚Äôt bagholders buy and sell litecoin is they are bitcoin traders and &lt;a href=&quot;/altcoin-exchanges/&quot;&gt;want to move USD from one exchange to the other&lt;/a&gt; whenever BTC is too volatile or too FUD-ridden to be safely in. By the way, that‚Äôs also what people sometimes use DOGE for but LTC is more widely supported. For one thing, it‚Äôs the only non-fiat and non-BTC way to get out of OkCoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-class-and-second-class&quot;&gt;First class and second class&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time this developed into a popular strategy: Altcoin traders might trade the first class altcoins - think &lt;a href=&quot;/coin/eth/&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/coin/xmr/&quot;&gt;Monero&lt;/a&gt;. Once they feel like the bull cycle is soon to be over they park the money in the second grade alts that remain more or less stable. With the money in the second class they wait for another opportunity in the first class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second class coins rarely dump without pumping first so it‚Äôs not a totally unreasonable idea, especially if you don‚Äôt pick the parking coin completely by random. Sometimes the second grade coins do pump which makes for a nice benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-reason&quot;&gt;The Reason‚Ñ¢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless it wouldn‚Äôt be a proper pump without people coming up with arbitrary rationalization of the surge. In the case of the Litecoin surge the rationalization says it‚Äôs network scaling implementation that is currently still argued about in BTC. This way LTC could be a flagship - if anything the market is letting everybody know that &lt;em&gt;little less conversation little more action please&lt;/em&gt; is what makes the community happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/chart/LTCBTC/cFRt8jgX-LTC-BTC-this-time-is-different-lol/&quot;&gt;btc_joe‚Äôs TradingView idea&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a world where bitcoin gets bigger and bigger (and thus less and less likely to make any &lt;strong&gt;consensus changes&lt;/strong&gt; whether it be a hard fork or segwit, etc), ask yourself, does litecoin deserve a place in the market? I certainly have my opinion.  Not to mention, if it gets the &lt;strong&gt;lightning network&lt;/strong&gt; before bitcoin‚Ä¶are you excited about this technology? I certainly am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this news came in a moment where the market was so to say available to be affected by the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litecoin was in a downtrend for all of 2016. Technically the price (relatively to BTC) was closing towards a support back from pre-pump 2013 (see BTC-e Quandl data &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quandl.com/data/BTCE/BTCLTC&quot;&gt;https://www.quandl.com/data/BTCE/BTCLTC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/img/trading/ltcbtc-quandl.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/img/trading/ltcbtc-quandl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after that the BTC ETF and BU FUD took over which helped as well. On the April fool‚Äôs day someone started signaling segwit on the LTC network originally as a joke but lo and behold, traders took it quite seriously because the discussion was ongoing since February already, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@thecryptoconomy/the-barely-discussed-incredible-benefit-of-the-lightning-network-4ce82c75eb58&quot;&gt;this medium.com post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With the adoption of Segregated Witness and the announcements of support progressing quickly within the Litecoin network, we may first get to see the full benefits of this technology on one of the original altcoins. With a smaller market cap and some distance from contentious Bitcoin politics, Litecoin is able to take greater risks. It may get to be the first to see this incredible innovation in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;laggards-beware&quot;&gt;Laggards beware&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/img/trading/litecoin-coinbase.png&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/img/trading/litecoin-coinbase.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: You see that squishy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Litecoin &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GDAX&quot;&gt;@GDAX&lt;/a&gt; vol is over $10M. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong&quot;&gt;@brian_armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, I think it&amp;#39;s time we let people easily buy LTC with fiat on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/coinbase&quot;&gt;@coinbase&lt;/a&gt;. What do you say? üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/849792340357029888&quot;&gt;6 April 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prognosis of Arthur Hayes in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/?u=db45c09bdf20e1866bb32123f&amp;amp;id=256c134334&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; is that LTC is bound to go down since GDAX got the USD pair too when it showed such a pretty activity now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that this is what‚Äôs going to happen: GDAX is the exchange removed far from the Poloniex altcoin trading epicenter. It‚Äôs where a newly listed altcoin might be bought by laggards who don‚Äôt really know much about its market but hope to still make a buck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They‚Äôll be buying the coins sold by those who bought at Polo early enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-technicals&quot;&gt;The Technicals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the cryptowatch snapshot above you‚Äôll probably be able to tell the current action looks like &lt;em&gt;wave 4&lt;/em&gt;. The people who timed it right took their profits but there is still some buying by those who came a bit late. It should still make for one more up before crashing though, and how big the crash will be, nobody knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/img/trading/BTC-squishies.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/img/trading/BTC-squishies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, altcoins in general are in a bull market. As such, the end of the wave cycle shouldn‚Äôt be as dreary as it was in 2013. In a bull market, the end of the cycle could be a simple consolidation and after a few weeks there could be more of the movement up north - see the image from the BTCUSD market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case one should look into fundamentals for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the case of litecoin, this doesn‚Äôt end up on a positive note: no real adoption, not much innovation. For cryptogeeks it‚Äôs a legacy, it‚Äôll stick around for some time no matter what, but in the real world litecoin as a name is nonexistent. That shouldn‚Äôt make for an exciting future‚Ä¶Unless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-lightning-network-plans&quot;&gt;The lightning network plans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶Unless LN. The Lightning Network can bridge channels between different blockchains, possibly allowing users to use their LTC at places that accepts Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlie Lee via &lt;a href=&quot;https://litecointalk.io/t/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-by-charlie-lee/600&quot;&gt;litecointalk.io&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(Y)ou may wonder why I‚Äôm pushing for SegWit. Litecoin does not have a block size problem. That‚Äôs right, and SegWit is not just a block scaling solution. I would even say block scaling is just a side benefit of SegWit. The main fix is transaction malleability, which would &lt;strong&gt;allow Lightning Networks (LN)&lt;/strong&gt; to be built on top of Litecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(S)ome people say LN on Bitcoin will kill any reason to use Litecoin. If people can do instantaneous transactions on Bitcoin, why would they use Litecoin? My gut feel is that this is not the case. [‚Ä¶] LN nodes will charge a fee for LN txns going through them and that fee will be relative to the Bitcoin network fee. So &lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin LN txns will be more expensive than Litecoin LN&lt;/strong&gt; txns. It may make economic sense for a LN txn to go via Litecoin and back to Bitcoin to get the cheapest rate. Lightning makes this possible because it allows the two LN to be &lt;strong&gt;interoperable&lt;/strong&gt;. I don‚Äôt know that this use case will be economical or not, but we won‚Äôt know until both LNs are built and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>About the proposed Ethereum ETF</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;/img/emotions/document.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/img/emotions/document.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The surveillance section of the rule change seems to be the key part after the rejection of Winklevoss COIN ETF. EtherIndex‚Äôs suggestion seems more plausible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix clearfix adfix&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-ad layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;728px&quot; height=&quot;90px&quot; type=&quot;adsense&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-6979812205705127&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;4445157690&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-ad&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the SEC disapproved the rule change to allow listing of Bitcoin ETF on the 10th of March 2017 the majority opinion has been along the lines that other cryptocurrency ETFs most likely don‚Äôt have a chance because all cryptocurrency markets are unregulated. Nonetheless there is a nice twist in the rule change for ETH ETF - an idea that didn‚Äôt appear in the Bitcoin rule change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;etherindex---the-eth-exchange-traded-fund&quot;&gt;EtherIndex - The ETH Exchange Traded Fund&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial S-1 filling for the ETH fund appeared in July 2016 after the SEC opening a proposal for the COIN ETF for public comment and also right after a filing by SolidX to launch a Bitcoin ETF. Laura Shin of Forbes commented the ‚Äúfiling appears to be hastily put together‚Äù:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EtherIndex itself was only founded a month ago, and its filing is mostly incomplete, acting more as a shell or placeholder. It does not name an exchange, ticker, trustee or administrator. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/07/18/as-race-to-offer-first-bitcoin-etf-heats-up-new-company-files-to-create-an-ether-etf/#2e9e14a47d76&quot;&gt;via forbes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-s-1-filing&quot;&gt;The S-1 Filing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a snippet from the filing itself. It introduces Ether by comparison to Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on &lt;strong&gt;July 15, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ether is a digital asset (‚ÄúDigital Asset‚Äù) &lt;strong&gt;similar to bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt; that is not issued by any government, bank or central organization. [‚Ä¶] The Ethereum Network is a recent technological innovation, and the ether that is created, transferred, used and stored by entities and individuals have certain features associated with several types of assets, most notably commodities and currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Trust‚Äôs Sponsor is EtherIndex LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed on &lt;strong&gt;June 15, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679791/000121390016015007/fs12016_etherindexether.htm#a_001&quot;&gt;via sec.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, further down in the text it clears up distinctions between Ether and Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the bitcoin network permits users primarily to execute value transfers, the Ethereum Network allows users to program any arbitrary code and execute it, including value transfers. [‚Ä¶] The Ethereum Network may be viewed as a &lt;strong&gt;global, decentralized computer&lt;/strong&gt; in comparison to the bitcoin network, which is more
similar to a global, decentralized &lt;strong&gt;payment network&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679791/000121390016015007/fs12016_etherindexether.htm#a_001&quot;&gt;via sec.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filing also explains that as Bitcoin is meant more like a store of value it has a cap on the amount of BTC that will be ever mined. It goes on to say that ETH has no such cap and more Ether will be created as needed, but the utility of Ether is primarily not a store of value or a payment system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nonexistent cap has been controversial ans is also the reason why this &lt;a href=&quot;https://moneymorning.com/2016/07/20/bitcoin-etfs-can-work-but-this-ethereum-etf-wont/&quot;&gt;moneymorning.com&lt;/a&gt; article claims that an ETH ETF can never work - it is supposed to be a bad idea since ETH has no cap on the amount of Ether that will be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-rule-change&quot;&gt;The Rule Change&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule change to allow listing of an ETF trading Ether shares was published in January 2017. The ETH ETF should be listed under NYSE Arca Equities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Release No. 34-79792; File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2016-176, January 13, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ‚ÄúAct‚Äù)2 and
Rule 19b-4 thereunder,3 notice is hereby given that, on December 30, 2016, NYSE Arca, Inc.
(the ‚ÄúExchange‚Äù or ‚ÄúNYSE Arca‚Äù) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
‚ÄúCommission‚Äù) the proposed rule change [‚Ä¶] The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Exchange proposes to list and trade shares of the following under &lt;strong&gt;NYSE Arca
Equities&lt;/strong&gt; Rule 8.201: EtherIndex Ether Trust (‚ÄúTrust‚Äù).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the EtherIndex ETF, Coinbase is supposed to be the custodian and the pricing should be based on GDAX dollar price of ETH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The
Exchange proposes to list and trade shares (‚ÄúShares‚Äù) of the Trust pursuant to NYSE Arca
Equities [‚Ä¶] The sponsor of the Trust is EtherIndex LLC (‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù), a Delaware limited liability
company. Delaware Trust Company is the trustee of the Trust (‚ÄúTrustee‚Äù). The Bank of New
York Mellon will be the administrator (‚ÄúAdministrator‚Äù) and custodian of cash of the Trust
(‚ÄúCash Custodian‚Äù). &lt;strong&gt;Coinbase will be the custodian of the ether of the Trust (‚ÄúEther
Custodian‚Äù)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2017/34-79792.pdf&quot;&gt;via sec.gov (Release No. 34-79792; File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2016-176)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the participation of Coinbase/GDAX itself seems to be a better idea compared to the Winklevoss Gemini - an exchange that doesn‚Äôt have much volume and was probably created only with the ETF in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting part comes with the Surveillance section of the ETH ETF rule change though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn‚Äôt care about the Bitcoin ETF much you might not know it but insufficient control over BTC markets (both spot and derivatives) was the most prominent critic the SEC mentioned in their order disapproving the COIN ETF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Order disapproving rule change for COIN ETF&lt;/em&gt;: [‚Ä¶] the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act,
which requires [‚Ä¶] to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices [‚Ä¶]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[‚Ä¶] First, the
exchange must have &lt;strong&gt;surveillance-sharing agreements&lt;/strong&gt; with significant markets for trading the
underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those &lt;strong&gt;markets must be
regulated&lt;/strong&gt;. Based on the record before it, the Commission believes that the &lt;strong&gt;significant&lt;/strong&gt; markets for
&lt;strong&gt;bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;unregulated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/batsbzx/2017/34-80206.pdf&quot;&gt;via sec.gov (Release No. 34-80206; File No. SR-BatsBZX-2016-30)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEC didn‚Äôt like the fact that majority of BTC trading occurs on exchanges out of their reach. Should a manipulation occur the SEC also wouldn‚Äôt be able to find out who‚Äôs causing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surveillance-sharing agreement was a term that caught on quickly at Bitcoin trading forums. It quickly solidified into ‚Äúthe SEC wanted access to data about customers, exchanges didn‚Äôt want to provide it‚Äù. How did this surveillance-sharing agreement come about? It was the central point of the Bats rule change for COIN ETF:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bats rule change / Surveillance&lt;/em&gt;: The Exchange believes that its surveillance procedures are adequate to properly monitor
the trading of the Shares on the Exchange during all trading sessions and to deter and detect
violations of Exchange rules and the applicable federal securities laws. [‚Ä¶] The Exchange may obtain information regarding trading in the Shares via the Intermarket Surveillance Group
(‚ÄúISG‚Äù), from other exchanges who are members or affiliates of the ISG, or with which the
Exchange has entered into a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. In addition, &lt;strong&gt;the
Exchange may obtain information&lt;/strong&gt; about bitcoin transactions, trades and market data &lt;strong&gt;from
Bitcoin Exchanges&lt;/strong&gt; with which the Exchange has entered into a &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement&lt;/strong&gt; as well as certain additional information that is publicly available through the
Blockchain. The Exchange notes that &lt;strong&gt;it has entered&lt;/strong&gt; into a comprehensive surveillance sharing
agreement &lt;strong&gt;with Gemini Exchange&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/batsbzx/2016/34-78262.pdf&quot;&gt;via sec.gov (Release No. 34-78262; File No. SR-BatsBZX-2016-30)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it the Winkletwins‚Äô idea that exchanges should agree to provide data so that there can be an ETF listed? There is no mention about surveillance-sharing agreement in the EtherIndex rule change. Instead, the exchange pleads to monitor the market and intervene in case there is an anomaly in the trading activity which could potentially be a manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given enough data this sounds like a plausible way to detect manipulation while at the same time there is no agreement needed whatsoever: the market data are freely accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NYSE rule change / Surveillance&lt;/em&gt;: The Exchange represents that trading in the Shares will be subject to the existing trading
surveillances administered by the Exchange, as well as cross-market surveillances administered
by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (‚ÄúFINRA‚Äù) on behalf of the Exchange&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The surveillances referred to above generally focus on &lt;strong&gt;detecting securities trading outside
their normal patterns&lt;/strong&gt;, which could be indicative of &lt;strong&gt;manipulative&lt;/strong&gt; or other violative &lt;strong&gt;activity&lt;/strong&gt;.
When such situations are detected, surveillance analysis follows and investigations are opened,
where appropriate, to review the behavior of all relevant parties for all relevant trading
violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule change also states that price of Ether shares should be determined based on GDAX ETHUSD market but if the market will seem unhealthy, a Kraken pricing might be used. If Kraken is not available, it would be Gemini. If no big American exchange provides reasonable data, &lt;em&gt;the pricing of Ether shares can be set manually&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[‚Ä¶] if the Sponsor determines that the Kraken Bitcoin Exchange and the Gemini
Exchange prices are not appropriate bases for evaluation of the Trust‚Äôs ether, &lt;strong&gt;the Sponsor‚Äôs&lt;/strong&gt; [EtherIndex LLC] &lt;strong&gt;good
faith estimate&lt;/strong&gt; of the market price of ether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course one question is whether there was a reason the Winklevoss brothers opted for the tedious and probably next to impossible route of surveillance agreements - or whether simply nobody considered this way. In the recent days &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coindesk.com/winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-relaunch-analysts-chance/&quot;&gt;Bats filed a petition for the SEC to change their decision and list the COIN ETF after all&lt;/a&gt; but even now there has been no change made to the proposal. And another question is indeed what will the SEC actually say to the EtherIndex suggested solution for the surveillance and control problem. We‚Äôll have to wait for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, one thing that could surely help the ETH ETF is the majority of ETH/fiat trading occurs in the US. Only very small amount of ETH/fiat trading happens in China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, from a legacy investor point of view it does not make such a fundamental difference whether to invest in Bitcoin or in Ether. The two currencies trade like competitors, very often they are inversely correlated, while both of them are equally uncorrelated with all of the legacy markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;one-more-important-detail&quot;&gt;One more important detail&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is backed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://entethalliance.org/&quot;&gt;https://entethalliance.org/&lt;/a&gt;. The EEA is a group of about 30 companies that include Accenture, JPMorgan Chase or Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
