        <title><![CDATA[ 3 Most Dangerous Cryptocurrency Beginner Mistakes ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ As the interest in crypto picked up a bit in 2020, so are the number of crypto newbies repeating the same old mistakes as the 2016 lot. Let's take a look at the three most dangerous of them. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ The year 2020 is the time when once again, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and even the smaller altcoins are going through a new surge in both price and common interest.

The last time the crypto markets had a record transaction traffic as well as steep rise in valuation was in 2017-2018. That was the height of the so called market bull run.

The Crypto Bull Run Attracted Newbies For A Reason

Even the most mature and conservative crypto-asset Bitcoin gained crazy percentages in dollar value and soared just past the $20k mark in January 2018.

This was an incredible rise since just a year before that in January 2017, one BTC was worth about $700. That’s 28 times your investment in just one year.

This kind of year-on-year gain makes it is easy to understand why the cryptocurrency market is now attracting people from all over the world. All are hoping for their chance to win big when investing in Bitcoin, or in an altcoin.

The rush and greed that goes through the mind of any investor is completely understandable. Many hope that a small $100 investment could be worth $2800 just one year later once again.

Will the history repeat itself? I don’t know. I feel positive for Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies, but that’s as much as I can say.

What I do know is that with every new investor that enters the market as a complete beginner, we keep seeing the same elementary mistakes. The news keep being reported about people losing money through their mistakes, there are Reddit and Facebook posts made by those users all the time as well.

Before the next bull run happens and with it the new surge in noob users, let us take a look at the 3 worst crypto beginner mistakes that you should avoid no matter what.

The 3 Riskiest Mistakes That You Should Know Before Investing In Crypto

1 - Thinking that a low dollar value means it’s cheap

A lot of beginners are looking to find the next BTC and the next ETH. That is the reason why many newbies invested in LTC instead of BTC as soon as Bitcoin started getting set in four-digit dollar values.

People look at prices as a way to evaluate the amount of growth the crypto-asset’s price will get.

It doesn’t work like that.

Just because this tokens is valued at $0.04 cent per token doesn’t mean it’s cheap. If nothing else, the price will be based on the total available supply. There might be hundred billions of tokens available, or even an uncapped amount of tokens to be generated.

A low USD price doesn’t mean the cryptocurrency must be undervalued. Use the market capitalisation instead to compare value between different cryptocurrencies.

2 - Keeping your cryptocurrencies on an exchange

I know it’s easy to buy a cryptocurrency on an exchange like Coinbase or Binance and then just leave it there. It works at that moment, you can tell yourself that most likely nothing will happen, or that your exchange is trustworthy, and so on.

But there are considerable risks to leaving your cryptocurrencies on any exchange.

You are basically leaving your cryptocurrencies in the hands of Coinbase or Binance and hoping that they won’t get hacked and won’t shut down.

And not it’s not the same thing as leaving your funds in a bank account.

Bank funds are normally insured up to a certain amount, and then there are processes in place to refund any stolen funds. It doesn’t work the same with cryptocurrencies. Crypto-assets are still seen as high risk, crypto exchanges are often dubious offshore setups and regulations on the market are inconsistent at best, which is why business credit corporations are not exactly queuing up to insure crypto trading platforms or wallets.

Some exchanges are better than others. There can be reimbursement funds or partial insurance for fully verified customers from certain domiciles. But it’s not foolproof.

It is much better to get yourself a wallet that you fully own, and learn how cryptocurrency wallets work. Make a safe backup of your private keys and do your part to secure your crypto.


  TIP: Your wallet should live on a device that is not used for your daily activities. Use either a hardware wallet or make sure your wallet lives on a device you don’t use for anything else, such an old phone.


3 - Falling for a silly scams

Unfortunately the crypto markets space is full of scams. Have you heard about OneCoin or Bitconnect?

Typical scam or a ponzi scheme promises great returns. That is exactly what most new crypto investors are coming for, and so some crypto scams can be really successful. Usually you will have to start contributing to a pyramid scheme, or pay membership fees. This money is then used to finance some of the returns before the scheme collapses. You only make some money bac if you get in very early while it is still cheap.

So if you come by an offer that sounds too good to be true, then 99/100 times it will in fact be too good be true and probably some kind of trick. A trick where you would need to deposit money to earn money in the future.

Maybe it will even work for a while to entice you to invest more. But eventually the scheme will fail.

Just be aware that due to the lack of regulations, investment scams are still happening more often in the cryptocurrency space.

Conclusion

There are many positive things happening in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries. And there is again new wide-spread interest building up around Bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies.

And that’s great to see.

But what’s less positive are these mistakes, scams and crypto hacks happening.

I hope that this article it might encourage you to learn more about cryptocurrency wallets or the crypto OPSEC in general, and you will manage to avoid these three common crypto-beginners mistakes!

        <title><![CDATA[ In 2020, Women Are Finally Breaking Into the Bitcoin Industry ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Typically thought of as a male-dominated industry, the numbers of women on the crypto markets are reportedly increasing. Why is that and what does it mean? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Are there many women on the bitcoin markets?

Due to the pseudonymity of Bitcoin, the total counts of Bitcoin wallets held by women is forever speculative. The cryptocurrency was designed in such a way that the owner of it would not need to provide self-identifying material in order to interact with the digital currency.

Still, as adoption rates have soared, analytics and oversight have started peeling back the veil.

This is because governmental legislation in some countries begins to tighten its grip on digital currencies and reporting the world over as adoption continues to rise.

What was once built to be a fully decentralized arena, the “Wild West” of currency exchange, is now subject to KYC practices and tax liability.

Exchanges report increase in user numbers

Which might not be a bad thing. At the very least, it gives us more information about who is actually on the market.

As more new users introduce themselves into the cryptocurrency market, using online exchange platforms like Bitvavo, bitcoin markets have seen a surge in women users.

This may suggest the cryptocurrency markets are stabilizing. Perhaps Bitcoin is indeed becoming the safe-haven asset it has long been touted to be.

Women in Tech

Historically speaking, women rarely showed up to the bargaining tables and boardrooms of tech companies and financial industries.

While numbers are slowly starting to find an equilibrium these days, women still only make up anywhere from 10 to 30 percent of this workforce.

Prior to 2018, these numbers were reflected even more poorly in the Bitcoin arena. At least according to the estimates, women were making up less than 7% of cryptocurrency users in 2017. The market created approximately $85 billion of wealth creation that year, but apparently women were not around for that.

So why the change in 2020?

Bitcoin was historically touted as a “boys club” straight from its humble beginnings. While no one knew exactly who started the digital currency, as its founder Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym, one that has never been attributed to any one person or group of people.

But, the currency got its start in the ultra-male focused field of technology sciences, going even deeper than standard IT circles - into the mega geek recesses of PC gamers and cyberpunk communities.

The original forums and social apps that promoted bitcoin, like Reddit and 4chan, are still to this day marketed to and largely populated by males. To the point that bitcoin and blockchain industries pre-late 2018 were having meetings in strip clubs and the virtual backrooms of these male-centric digital social clubs.

Whether this was an active effort to shut out female participation, or just a natural expression of a historically male-dominated field is up for debate.

Why Women Choose Bitcoin

It was thought that this disparity exists largely because of the underground origins of the coin. Bitcoin was first made famous for bent-truth applications like purchasing illegal pornography, drugs, and even weapons or hitmen on the dark web.

However, following the FBI raid and shut down of the “Silk Road” the famous underground den of iniquity where such purchases could be made, Bitcoin adoption didn’t falter.

That left many to wonder just how true those original claims were.

Either way, women have been slow to adopt digital currencies and blockchain technology.

Some of the modern spins on evolutionary theory proclaim that this is because of the difference in the social values of many women, where concerns lie heavily with supporting families.

Women are found to be far more risk-averse than men, suggesting that choosing to delve into budding tech businesses and highly volatile market speculation is less likely to appeal to women on a psychological level.

Which may explain why the crypto industry is only really starting to capture the female interest and adoption in 2020. The industry is somewhat more established. The dollar valuation of Bitcoin is somewhat stable, at least compared to the past.

More women are starting to show up as investors, traders, analysts, journalists, developers, and startup leaders. Massive crypto companies like Binance and Bancor lend credence to this theory, as near 50% of their employees are female.

More ICOs and blockchain startups are being spearheaded by women in 2020. Tezos, arguably one of the most exciting ICOs since Ethereum is co-founded by a woman. Blockchain divisions of IBM and JPMorgan Chase are headed by women.

In the past two years, women in blockchain-related industries have increased from 8% to 12%, with no signs of stopping. Women like Elizabeth Stark, founder of bitcoins’ Lightning Network protocol, are paving the way for lower tiers of women-focused involvement.

Changing Times

The increasing interest from women may make sense, especially when weighed against the historic participation of women in business fields.

Generally speaking, the integration of digital currencies became commonplace throughout many sectors of everyday life. Even if those are not necessarily cryptocurrencies, it is now less outlandish to imagine investing into a cryptocurrency even for someone who is fairly conservative.

Also, a whole another point of view comes up in the light of the current economic recession or even the previous government failures in some countries, where Bitcoin already offers a more stable choice of income for anyone who works remotely.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Whether you want to join the madness of altcoin trading or you just want to buy and hold, this is a 2020 overview of the reliable platforms to buy all the good crypto that is not Bitcoin.

Trading Altcoins: Best exchanges for speculation

Let’s first look at what is important.

What should you be looking for in an exchange for altcoin speculation?

Your priorities


  Liquidity


This is most important for day-trading, scalping or other short term kinds of speculation. You want to submit your order and have it filled with not much issues.

Chinese exchanges are great for that, they are always busy enough due to the higher popularity of speculation and also, quite honestly, due to the fake volume generating bots.

However, many trading platforms in Asia notoriously don’t do small altcoins much. Listing fees on the most liquid places like OKex or Binance are too high for small projects. You might be more lucky on places like YoBit.

Most liquid altcoin exchanges:


  Binance - wide selection of alts, deep liquidity
  OKEx - smaller selection of big alts but easy access to derivatives
  Yobit - busy and liquid den of wild speculation, big and small alts
  Bitfinex - unique selection of alts but not always super liquid
  BitMEX - only a few alts, but accessible alt derivatives


Not recommended - Poloniex, HitBTC and smaller places that are just as sketchy.


  Stability


The platform stability is likewise important for active trading. A trading platform needs to have downtime for maintenance but this should be scheduled.

A crypto exchange shouldn’t really crash under heavy traffic - ever. Trading platforms earn crazy money on fees, they can afford server maintenance just fine.

Most stable crypto exchanges:


  Binance - occasional downtime communicated via Twitter
  OKEx - hardly any downtime
  Yobit - occasional downtime
  Bitfinex - was hacked in 2016 but generally stable
  BitMEX - servers unreachable very often, not recommended



  Availability on TradingView


If you are at least occasionally taking technical analysis seriously, you will want to have your exchange on TradingView. All the bigger trading platforms are there - Binance, Bitfinex, BitMEX.

Less important parameters


  
    Fiat markets. For altcoin speculation you don’t need USD or other fiat markets at all. The ratios in which alts are traded is often BTC or ETH. To track a fiat value, in 2020 we use DAI or another stablecoin.
  
  
    AML/KYC for pure altcoin trading is still an overkill in many places. Go with that.
  
  
    In-house charts. Use TradingView FREE or Cryptowat.ch.
  


Trading Altcoin Derivatives

BitMEX

BitMEX is a cryptocurrency derivative platform. You cannot buy altcoins or bitcoin on BitMEX with your national currency, you can only trade their products for profit. You get your winnings paid out in BTC.

Currently the most traded products are BTC futures, ZEC futures and BTC permanent swap (derivative mimicking spot BTCUSD market). New altcoin derivative markets keep being added as the altcoin flavors of the month come and go.

US customers are not allowed to sign up to the platform per T&amp;amp;C but Tor/VPN access is not blocked.

Buying Altcoins

To buy altcoins for long-term holding, with no plans to actively trading them, you have two options - buying altcoins for fiat or for other crypto.

Buy altcoins for Bitcoin, Ethereum or other big crypto

If you want to invest in smaller altcoins, your last step before the purchase will always be the purchase of a bigger crypto, as there are no fiat markets for new niche cryptocurrencies.

If you already own a big crypto, you can exchange it for smaller altcoins on any of the liquid spot exchanges good for trading.


  Binance - wide selection of altcoin markets denominated in BTC, ETH, exchange coin or stablecoins
  Yobit - wide selection of altcoin markets denominated in BTC, ETH
  Bitfinex - some selection of alts denominated in BTC, ETH, USDT


Buying altcoins for crypto is also the preferred way if you want to make your purchase anonymous.


  LocalCryptos lets you buy your initial ETH and BTC completely anonymously.
  Do NOT use LocalBitcoins in 2020, they collaborate.


Otherwise, if you don’t mind being verified, you can buy your initial coins on any of the big-name exchanges. You will pretty much always find a BTC, LTC and ETH market denominated in USD or other fiat.


  Bitstamp
  Gemini
  GDAX
  Kraken
  Independent Reserve


Bitfinex has fiat routes as well, but it’s a bit of a cat and mouse game.

Buy altcoins directly for fiat

You can only buy the bigger cryptocurrencies directly for fiat. It is easy for BTC, ETH, LTC, XMR.

Selection of smaller cryptos differs exchange by exchange, depending on the platform’s business partnerships.

Centralized platforms (will require AML/KYC to let you purchase)

Big cryptos only:

  Bitstamp (EU)
  Gemini (US)
  GDAX (US)
  Independent Reserve (AU) - BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, BSV, USDT, LTC, EOS, XLM, ETC, BAT, OMG, REP, ZRX and GNT


Small cryptos thanks to partnerships:

  Kraken
  Bitfinex


Decentralized platforms


  LocalCryptos lets you buy your initial ETH and BTC completely anonymously.
  Do NOT use LocalBitcoins in 2020, they collaborate.


Altcoin traders from the US

You probably know about the witch hunt. US traders have it more difficult.

You have the following options:


  Verify on exchanges that are regulated within the US – Gemini, GDAX – if they will take you. They don’t accept all banks, all states and sometimes they just refuse for undisclosed reasons. These two are where you’ll have your deposits in the fastest.
  Verify on Bitstamp – EU-based but accepts US users. You will need to wire money to Slovenia, which might raise questions from your bank.
  Kraken used to be too unreliable for trading but has since gotten their platform together and now is an option. The Kraken exchange is still not to be found among the recommended platforms for speculation though, because the reliability of their stop-loss execution is still worse than that of a weather forecast.
  Bitfinex stopped servicing verified US residents in November 2017. Practically, this only applies to verified accounts, and KYC is not mandatory for crypto-only trading on the platform. If you access Bitfinex from a location in the United States, you will just be asked to claim that US is not your primary country of residence. Once you’ve done that, the interface will let you through.


Once you onramp, even if via p2p or whatever, your problem is kind-of solved. You can and trade unverified on Bitmex (with VPN), Bitfinex, Bittrex or elsewhere.

        <description><![CDATA[ Where to store cryptocurrencies? Best ERC20 cold storage? See a list of altcoin wallets including multicoin wallets, web based wallets and hardware wallets. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Lets start this article about altcoin wallets right off with the obligatory reminder.


  For hodlers: It is not a good idea to keep untraded cryptocurrency on an exchange.


Exchanges hold larger amounts of crypto than personal wallets and therefore are more targeted by cyber criminals.


  Read about the Tether hack in 2017
  Or about the DAO hack in 2016
  Or about the Bitfinex hack in 2016



  For traders: It is also not a good idea to send coins from one exchange to another.


Exchange transaction systems are a blackbox, especially with high-tech altcoins like Ethereum that support sending triggered by a smart contract.

An altcoin wallet will receive such transaction, but an exchange which has built in security mechanisms to avoid network spam might not. You can go spend months dealing with customer support to retrieve your funds, sure. But I guess you have better things to do.

And now, quick TLDR for those who don’t want to get paralyzed by too many options:

Your best bet in terms of altcoin storage

Everyone’s Favorite Altcoin Wallet: The Ledger Nano X

Ledger Nano X is particularly good for altcoin traders because it has larger memory capacity. That means a single device can house private keys of many more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.

Ledger wallets were the pioneers of supporting altcoins, and you will find most cryptos are supported unless they are really brand new.


  Some of the supported cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA, Ethereum Classic, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Dash, Ripple, Stratis and all ERC20 compliant Ethereum tokens.


Since 2019, all Ledger wallets come with a secure app suite called Ledger Live.

The Nano X is often offered in discount bundles and recently Ledger also started experimenting with discount codes. We keep all such offers throughout the year on our Black Friday page.

  The smartphone app can be unlocked with PIN or fingerprint.
  You automatically get the Blockchain.com web wallet access. It is a web wallet, which is less secure, but it has several levels of MFA (multi-factor authentication) and a whitelist option.
  The Blockchain.com wallet offers ID verification option for your account. Verified users get access to airdrops, fiat-to-crypto exchange and ETH staking wallet.


Be careful though: The blockchain.com wallet is the favorite target of imposter attacks. Always double check you are downloading the app from developer company Blockchain Luxembourg SARL.


  Single-coin Wallet Apps


Some less mainstream cryptocurrencies are still not supported by the populat multi-coin wallets like Jaxx or Exodus. Some of them do have their own wallet apps for smartphones now, though.


  MyMonero
  IOTA Trinity


MyMonero Lightweight Wallet



mymonero.com

MyMonero has been long endorsed on the Monero’s official website (getmonero.com).

MyMonero was originally only available as a web wallet. In 2020 you get the monero web wallet and a desktop/smartphone app.

The MyMonero wallet is super simple.

  To use it, you don’t have to sign up. Just access the app or website and start the mnemonic phrase generation.
  The mnemonic phrase is your private key.
  Your private key is not stored anywhere on the server, you are its sole owner. The danger is, you need to type in your seed into the web interface to access your wallet. This is not safe at all. If you google around, you will find reports from many people about their Monero vanishing from their account.


If you are put off my the need to type in the mnemonic with MyMonero, use Exodus wallet instead. It supports Monero.

IOTA Trinity Wallet App




  https://trinity.iota.org/


Trinity is a relatively new release, and the first IOTA wallet that works without weird high-tech settings hacks. Trinity is the official wallet for IOTA and it is a desktop and smartphone app.

Using Trinity is easy and great for beginners (not that you’d have much choice though) but you can still enable advanced, more technical mode.


  The app starts with the option to either use a private key or to generate a new one.
  If you are generating a new key, Trinity will force you to write it down and then TYPE IT BACK instead of copypasting it. This is good for security (but a pain in the a$$ because IOTA seeds are not mnemonic).
  The sync of the transactions is a bit sluggish but in general there is less of the problem with vanishing histories that we knew from previous IOTA wallets.

Hardware Wallets for Altcoins Storage

If you are planning to hold an altcoin for more than one year, you should really get a hardware wallet. You will still need to keep it updated, but in your case you are still getting the best security even from basic setups.

The reason is that your chances of messing up something or getting hacked are minimal if you have the private key on any dedicated device simply thanks to the fact that you don’t use the device on a daily basis.

The easiest choice here is a commercial hardware wallet device, but you can absolutely have a phone app on a dedicated smartphone, or Electrum on a dedicated laptop.



Ledger Wallet for Altcoins

It seems unbelievable now but back in 2016 Ledger Wallet used to claim they would not support any altcoins. They started adding altcoin support to Nano S with the first altcoin bubble in 2017.


  Nano S is not the best option though, because it has a limited memory capacity and can only hold one or two different crypto wallets.
  A single Ledger Nano X is way better in this aspect.
  You might still prefer Nano S if you want to split your holdings into multiple devices. There are bundles available.


Native Support: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Dash, Ripple, Stratis.

Via 3rd party private key management: All Ethereum tokens of the ERC20 standard. All ETH tokens can be managed using Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue with MyEtherWallet.

Trezor wallet for Altcoins

Trezor utilizes similar system as Ledger Wallet. There is a set of native apps, you are able to manage several cryptocurrency wallets from a web app after unlocking your access with your PIN.

Trezor is not as popular as ledger because it’s more expensive and less user-friendly.


  TREZOR supports natively: BTC, ETH, DASH, LTC and ZCASH.
  Via 3rd party private key management: Any ERC20 token via MyEtherWallet.

Electrum Forks

While Electrum for Bitcoin (https://electrum.org/) is a safe option, you should be careful with Electrum for altcoins. The altcoin versions of Electrum were not developed by the same author as the original Electrum.

They are just forks - the Electrum code is open-sourced.

Some of them can be malicious or forked from an old version of Electrum that has a vulnerability:



You should only use an Electrum fork if you are able to check its codebase and confirm the code is not malicious.

These two Electrum forks have been quite popular:

  Electrum for Litecoin - https://electrum-ltc.org/
  Electrum for Dash - https://www.dash.org/downloads


Web Based Multi-Altcoin Wallets

Most web-based wallets, the private keys are stored by a third party. You should not consider these as a safe altcoin storage.

Opt for blockchain.com or one of the multicoin wallets above for a good ratio of convenience and security.

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Lets start this article about altcoin wallets right off with the obligatory reminder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For hodlers: &lt;strong&gt;It is not a good idea to keep untraded cryptocurrency on an exchange.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exchanges hold larger amounts of crypto than personal wallets and therefore are more targeted by cyber criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/bitfinex-tether-transparency/&quot;&gt;Tether hack in 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/dao-hack/&quot;&gt;DAO hack in 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/finexening/&quot;&gt;Bitfinex hack in 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For traders: &lt;strong&gt;It is also not a good idea to send coins from one exchange to another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exchange transaction systems are a blackbox, especially with high-tech altcoins like Ethereum that support sending triggered by a smart contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An altcoin wallet will receive such transaction, but an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/bitifinex-eats-your-eth/&quot;&gt;exchange which has built in security mechanisms to avoid network spam might not&lt;/a&gt;. You can go spend months dealing with customer support to retrieve your funds, sure. But I guess you have better things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now, quick TLDR for those who don’t want to get paralyzed by too many options:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-best-bet-in-terms-of-altcoin-storage&quot;&gt;Your best bet in terms of altcoin storage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone’s Favorite Altcoin Wallet&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/lnx_at_altcoinwallets&quot;&gt;The Ledger Nano X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ledger Nano X is particularly good for altcoin traders because it has larger memory capacity. That means a single device can house private keys of many more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ledger wallets were the pioneers of supporting altcoins, and you will find most cryptos are supported unless they are really brand new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some of the supported cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA, Ethereum Classic, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Dash, Ripple, Stratis and &lt;strong&gt;all ERC20 compliant Ethereum tokens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, all Ledger wallets come with a secure app suite called Ledger Live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nano X is often offered in discount bundles and recently Ledger also started experimenting with discount codes. We keep all such offers throughout the year on our Black Friday page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multicoin wallet for deskop and smartphone with integrated an swap exchange inside the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exodus is currently your best option for a multicoin wallet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The amount of supported coins  is the largest (110 cryptocurrencies in 2020).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exodus supports Monero.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For Bitcoin, you automatically get a pair of legacy (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;-address) and segwit addresses (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bc&lt;/code&gt;-address, bech32 native segwit) so that you can always withdraw no matter what address type your exchange supports.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The customer support is great and you get a status page to check in case your app gets sluggish.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a swap exchange inside the app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exodus also integrates with hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/c_lpad,h_360,w_700/v1596614896/atnet/altcoin-wallets/exodus-android-app_en491r.jpg&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/c_lpad,h_360,w_700/v1596614896/atnet/altcoin-wallets/exodus-android-app_en491r.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Exodus wallet app is super user-friendly. It won’t let you do anything too technical, but it is great for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You launch the wallet as any other app, no user sign up. You can start from a seedphrase but you don’t have to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As there are over 100 altcoins supported, you need to enable wallet functionality for any coin you want to store.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wallets are &lt;strong&gt;generated for you without giving you their seed phrase&lt;/strong&gt; yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To backup your seedphrase, you first need to receive some coin into any wallet at all. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.exodus.io/article/41-how-do-i-backup-my-exodus-wallet&quot;&gt;Exodus backup option&lt;/a&gt; is only unlocked after you make a deposit. This way you will only have seed phrases written down that actually have money on them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The only owner of your private keys is you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not forget backing up your seed phrase!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the advanced options that you can choose in Exodus wallet is enabling the generation of new BTC addresses after each receiving transaction and setting up passcode or fingerprint lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exodus Supported Coins:&lt;/strong&gt; BTC, ETH, ERC20 tokens, Tezos, EOS, XRP, TRX… &lt;strong&gt;= 110 cryptoassets in total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jaxx-multicoin-wallet&quot;&gt;Jaxx Multicoin Wallet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/c_scale,w_700/c_crop,h_360,w_700/v1588058183/atnet/altcoin-wallets/Screen_Shot_2020-04-28_at_14.16.02_scvbmp.jpg&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/c_scale,w_700/c_crop,h_360,w_700/v1588058183/atnet/altcoin-wallets/Screen_Shot_2020-04-28_at_14.16.02_scvbmp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jaxx.io/&quot;&gt;https://www.jaxx.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still one of the most popular multicoin wallets these days is &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaxx.io/support.html&quot;&gt;Jaxx&lt;/a&gt;. It is available as browser extension, desktop app and mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaxx wallet is very user-friendly and good for the beginners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You launch the wallet as any other app, no user sign up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wallets are automatically generated for you. No seed handling etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To see your private keys (seed phrase), you need to run backup. &lt;strong&gt;Backup options is available even if you do not have any crypto in your wallet yet.&lt;/strong&gt; You will find the Backup option under &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; on the right hand side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The only owner of your private keys is you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not forget backing up your seed phrase!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Jaxx 1.2 you get &lt;a href=&quot;https://shapeshift.io/&quot;&gt;Shapeshift&lt;/a&gt; exchange integrated within the wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supported coins:&lt;/strong&gt; BTC, ETH, ERC20 via MyEtherWallet, ETC, DASH, LTC, REP, RSK, ZEC… &lt;strong&gt;= 90 cryptoassets in total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blockchaincom-wallet-for-btc-eth-and-xlm&quot;&gt;Blockchain.com Wallet for BTC, ETH and XLM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only need to store &lt;strong&gt;BTC, ETH and XLM&lt;/strong&gt;,  smartphone app for you in 2020 the &lt;strong&gt;blockchain.com&lt;/strong&gt; wallet (formerly blockchain.info).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful though: The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blockchain.com&lt;/code&gt; wallet is the favorite target of imposter attacks. Always double check you are downloading the app from developer company &lt;strong&gt;Blockchain Luxembourg SARL&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ledger-wallet-for-altcoins&quot;&gt;Ledger Wallet for Altcoins&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems unbelievable now but back in 2016 Ledger Wallet used to claim they would not support any altcoins. They started adding altcoin support to Nano S with the first altcoin bubble in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nano S is not the best option though, because it has a limited memory capacity and can only hold one or two different crypto wallets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A single &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/lnx_at_altcoinwallets&quot;&gt;Ledger Nano X&lt;/a&gt; is way better in this aspect.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You might still prefer Nano S if you want to split your holdings into multiple devices. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/bundles_at_altcoinwallets&quot;&gt;bundles available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trezor utilizes similar system as Ledger Wallet. There is a set of native apps, you are able to manage several cryptocurrency wallets from a web app after unlocking your access with your PIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trezor is not as popular as ledger because it’s more expensive and less user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TREZOR supports natively: &lt;strong&gt;BTC, ETH, DASH, LTC and ZCASH&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electrum-forks&quot;&gt;Electrum Forks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Electrum for Bitcoin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://electrum.org/#home&quot;&gt;https://electrum.org/&lt;/a&gt;) is a safe option, you should be careful with Electrum for altcoins. The altcoin versions of Electrum were not developed by the same author as the original Electrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are just forks - the Electrum code is open-sourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of them &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be malicious or forked from an old version of Electrum that has a vulnerability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/c_scale,w_700/c_crop,g_north,h_360,w_700/v1588053117/atnet/altcoin-wallets/Screen_Shot_2020-04-28_at_12.37.36_cqbzj7.jpg&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/c_scale,w_700/c_crop,g_north,h_360,w_700/v1588053117/atnet/altcoin-wallets/Screen_Shot_2020-04-28_at_12.37.36_cqbzj7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should only use an Electrum fork if you are able to check its codebase and confirm the code is not malicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two Electrum forks have been quite popular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Electrum for Litecoin - &lt;a href=&quot;https://electrum-ltc.org/&quot;&gt;https://electrum-ltc.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Electrum for Dash - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dash.org/downloads&quot;&gt;https://www.dash.org/downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;web-based-multi-altcoin-wallets&quot;&gt;Web Based Multi-Altcoin Wallets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most web-based wallets, the private keys are stored by a third party. You should not consider these as a safe altcoin storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opt for blockchain.com or one of the multicoin wallets above for a good ratio of convenience and security.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Will Your Bitcoin Investment Suffer from Coronavirus? ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ The changes cannot be ignored any longer. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ The global financial markets crash with every natural or man-made disaster. This has been going on for time immemorial, the governments and policy makers still have not found a way around it.

Some say it’s just the problem of fiat currencies, that they are not resilient enough. Fiat is easily impacted by disasters, wars, trade wars, hostilities, nature’s fury or anything that stirs the waters. These failures of governments, central banks and finance industry is felt most on the poorest classes of society.

In this article, we will look at why the coronavirus pandemic may propel the authorities to look at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a viable and resilient model.

Social classes most impacted by the Coronavirus crisis

Middle class and lower middle classes invest in low-risk schemes with the hope of creating a financial safety net. Yet, every time the market goes for a tumble billions of dollars of their hard-earned investments turn to dust.

The world has gone through many such disasters and typically, people who are in a position to take these decisions, do not fare for the masses.

The need of the hour is to give traditional financial systems a serious rethink. Why is it not possible to lessen the effects of disasters from our financial systems? This will help billions of people all over the world protect themselves, not die from hunger and continue living in a much better way.

Can Bitcoin emerge as a Relatively Stable Financial Asset in 2020?

Bitcoin was founded as a response to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008.

Its mythical Founder, Satoshi Nakamoto stated in the Bitcoin Whitepaper that the cryptocurrency is free from external influences. This means that factors like recession, inflation and natural emergencies do not have an effect on the valuation.

The aim of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency is to establish one single digital currency that holds the same value in every part of the world. This frees up currency manipulations, speculations and other negative implications that authorities have on fiat currencies.

Many people have the opinion that because any real assets do not back Bitcoin, it does not hold any value. A dollar or a pound boasts of a certain value, because the government says so.

Bitcoin is “Too volatile to be money”

When Bitcoin first emerged, the price of ‘One Bitcoin’ was a few dollars. In late 2017, the price of that same Bitcoin had skyrocketed to over $20000 USD! As you read this article, Bitcoin is trading at $7000 USD.

This has been the evergreen argument against Bitcoin’s use as money: It makes paying for services difficult if your means of payment is volatile.

Some financial experts and investors predict that the volatility associated with Bitcoins is gone.

There are still real effects in play that might influence the short-term prices of cryptocurrencies in unforeseen ways. One of them is the oil market crash in April 2020, which apparently influences crypto as the oil companies used their oil to generate electricity and mine Bitcoin:



Then there is also the bigger picture, though.

Even before the Coronavirus crisis, it was expected that in 2020 Bitcoin would surge in value and appreciate. It was not only because of the Bitcoin halving in May 2020. It was also known that some nations were taking a serious look at Bitcoins. India was among them. China too has advocated a positive response to cryptocurrencies.

Likewise, even before Coronavirus crisis there were several grassroots protest movements against how the lower end of working class is treated in Europe, and for democracy in Asia. The Yellow Vest movement paralyzed France even before Covid-19 and caused serious economic damage on its own.

The changes cannot be ignored

Even if that might have been the intention, apparently since 2019 it is no longer possible to treat the general population like a disposable clog in the global debt economy. The world economy will want to protect itself from shocks that cause it to come crashing down.

This is why private investors and asset managers are asking their clients to invest in Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.
They are looking for an alternative and a way to move forward. The liquidity and funding they provide at least for now also enables individuals to take part in cryptocurrency trading.

Conclusion

It is high time that policy makers and authorities try to change the rules of global finance. If this is not done, every emergency will cause billions of people to suffer. The world is slowly moving towards cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin’s presence and rise in valuation over the last decade is a testament to that fact.

        <title><![CDATA[ Script Spotlight: Bollinger Band Width ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ BBands Variations on Tradingview, focusing on Bollinger Bandwidth this time. In this series we are picking and reviewing TradingView scripts for technical analysis that recently popped up in the daily popular feed. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this Script Spotlight we are looking at scripts of Bollinger Band Width that are available from Tradingview public library. If you don’t have a TradingView account yet, make a free one here.

Bollinger Band Width

Bollinger band width indicator (or “bandwidth”) belongs to the more straightforward derivations of the famous Bollinger bands.

The gist of the Bollinger bandwidth script is essentially plotting the information about how far apart are the Standard Deviation lines of Bollinger bands, that is, the outer bands.



Bollinger bands is a technical analysis indicator providing information about volatility that, thanks to the indicator, is displayed in such a way that it can show more clearly in which direction is the market likely to move in the nearest future:


  The middle band is a moving average, typically the SMA, therefore the current mean or “average” price.
  The outer bands are standard deviations of that mean, measuring how far the current action has the price spike out away from its mean.
  Capital markets work in cycles, a directional movement (a bull run or a bear descent) always starts after at least a short relatively stable period - that is, period of lower volatility. And the other way around - if the price is running in a trend but the bandwidth is hitting its max, some topping out or re-accumulation range could soon follow.


There are two interesting versions of Bollinger band width on Tradingview:


  Simple Bollinger Bandwidth with high/low reference that just plots the width as a line and lets you compare different time periods.
  The IO_BBWidth script that uses weighted moving average and will color the background of your line chart when the market starts trending, so that you cannot tell yourself whatever fits your bias.


Let’s take a look at the IO-BB-Width.

Full script code

Does it work?

When you first load the script into a BTCUSD chart, with the default settings you will find that it shows the market always trending. The reason is, the default setting is meant for ultra short timeframes.

You will need to backtest the coloring threshold on the timeframe of your choice, based on the near past.

Once you’ve done that though, it’s actually a pretty useful piece of info because it will show you when the current run starts running out of steam.

While it is often just to take a breather (a short period of low volatility doesn’t always mean the run is over), if you’re trading with leverage or with timing limitation (such as with derivatives), you will definitely find this information useful and not enter any new positions until the situation starts clearing up.

Here is the indicator with 21 day WAP, stdev3 and a threshold of 500 on BTCUSD 4H:



You can see it is not super precise; it’s not the kind of information you should use to trigger your getting into a position - it’s far more valuable to consult it if you are considering getting out.

On a 5M chart for BTCUSD you can use the same information in a different way - here with the threshold of 150 you can see it will highlight just the time periods that happened to be most volatile. On super short timeframes you are of course not looking for a sustainable trend, but if you’re a scalper, this information is pretty good for you.



As with longer timeframes though - you will need to backtest it.

Summary

Bollinger bandwidth indicator in its basic form provides no new information, you can get all this just from looking at the bands.

It is just a more convenient way to display it, because with bbands you are adding a lot of new lines over your price action and it can get a little crowded there.

Having the bandwidth in a separate box under the price chart also lets you plot in additional things or set up squeeze alerts, which can come handy if you are scalping.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/bbw/io-bbw1.png&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Script Spotlight: Bollinger Band Width&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/bbw/io-bbw1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Script Spotlight: Bollinger Band Width&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Script Spotlight: Bollinger Band Width&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see it is not super precise; it’s not the kind of information you should use to trigger your getting into a position - it’s far more valuable to consult it if you are considering getting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a 5M chart for BTCUSD you can use the same information in a different way - here with the threshold of 150 you can see it will highlight just the time periods that happened to be most volatile. On super short timeframes you are of course not looking for a sustainable trend, but if you’re a scalper, this information is pretty good for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/bbw/io-bbw2.png&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Script Spotlight: Bollinger Band Width&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/bbw/io-bbw2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Script Spotlight: Bollinger Band Width&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Script Spotlight: Bollinger Band Width&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with longer timeframes though - you will need to backtest it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bollinger bandwidth indicator in its basic form provides no new information, you can get all this just from looking at the bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is just a more convenient way to display it, because with bbands you are adding a lot of new lines over your price action and it can get a little crowded there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the bandwidth in a separate box under the price chart also lets you plot in additional things or set up squeeze alerts, which can come handy if you are &lt;a href=&quot;/strategy/scalping/&quot;&gt;scalping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  Products of 2019


Trading

The biggest change from the 2018 meta post is probably the cool-off of BitMEX affiliate earnings.

This comes quite as a surprise: The overall volume traded on BitMEX pretty much follows the price of Bitcoin. There were no crazy bubbles in either of the past two years, but the platform did make a decent traded volume in the summer of 2019. Could it be that gamblers with 300 USD worth of stash perhaps get convinced they are winning at life with every 5% uptick? Either way - the readers of this blog apparently did not follow.

On the other hand there was a noticeable shift to Bitfinex once again, ever since they re-opened their affiliate program for the main custodial trading platform. It is almost funny considering their notorious banking issues and the whole Tether thing, but the commission patterns suggest that some people are DCA’ing there.

Additionally, since the new affiliate platform on Bitfinex pays you out in the currency spent by the referred user, let me tell you that the activity has been predominantly fiat getting spent and shitcoins getting flipped. There has been next to no selling of top-tier cryptocurrencies from the readers of this blog.

Other crypto trading platforms

Near the end of the year there have been several new products added and while it will be for the next year to see how they do, there has been some interest into the 3commas DCA bot.

Stash Management

It is no surprise that one of the biggest product hits of the year 2019 was Ledger Nano X. A new product and on top of that offered in bulk packages on several different occasions during the whole year - usually in a discount combo with a Nano S.

A lot of people bought these bulk packs especially during Black Friday but by far not only then.

From competing products, Keepkey is pretty much forgotten while Trezor does have some user base but Ledger is still the winner here.

Hardware seed-phrase storage Billfodl (and Cryptosteel for the EU analog) have been linked from here only for a small part of the year but appear to pass for vanity products rather than something to rely on.

Technical Analysis

By far the biggest hit among AltcoinTrading.NET readers during all of 2019 were the subscription plans to the charting platform TradingView!

This is something that crypto traders have been buying a lot through the whole year, and the shift from entertainment and high-leverage trading to analysis comes as a change in comparison with the past.

One of the reasons of last year’s uptick could be that TradingView started accepting subscription payments in crypto early in 2019: While for the majority of shoppers in general implementing payments in crypto is in fact an unnecessary gimmick, for us who buy, sell and move cryptocurrencies on the daily it does make things easier. - Certainly easier than trying to log into your Paypal account from a third world country.

From the perspective of the crowd around this blog I think it is safe to say that TradingView PRO is the product of 2019.

Needless to say, the interest in the more advanced platform TensorCharts has been tiny compared to TradingView.

That may be sad for the founder but then again it is obvious that learning to use the orderbook heatmap and other TensorCharts features can still give you an edge, even though the product is a couple of years old already.

Let’s see what 2020 brings!

        <title><![CDATA[ Technical Analysis in Cryptocurrency Trading ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Technical indicators work. Sometimes. Should you use technical analysis for crypto? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ This post on cryptocurrency technical analysis specifics was originally published in 2016.

Back then, it was a common debate in the TradingView chat whether technical analysis in crypto can actually work at all.

Does Technical Analysis Work in Crypto?

It was the time when the multi-year bull market in Bitcoin and most other cryptos was in its infancy, the markets were acting wild and every futures contract settlement day was filled with what Reddit dubbed the “Bart formation”: A steep rise in a single candle that doesn’t really catch on and is subsequently dumped in another single candle, or alternatively the opposite sequence known as the “inverse Bart”.



This used to be the daily bread of the BTCUSD market back in the day when it was a niche play, and it still can look this wild on small-cap altcoin markets.

In contrast to that, traders using some technical analysis tools and methods (along with healthy skepticism and well-trained judgement) have been more successful than not on the crypto markets.

The reason lies in the way technical analysis works in general.

So, how does technical analysis work at all?

Always loyal to my first trading principle:- Draw a lot of lines so it will look like you know what you are doing. pic.twitter.com/na9WaByn28&amp;mdash; via Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand)

The problematic part lies in the way technical analysis works, not only in crypto but on any kind of market in general.

Technical trading in its core is about looking for chart patterns. Chart patterns are sequences of price action that are vaguely repetitive, which means that if you notice a pattern in the making, you have slightly better odds when speculating on what the price will do next.

Technical Trading as Relying on the Machine

One aspect of technical trading relies on what could be called the mechanical capabilities of the markets.

It is reasonable to assume some resistance to change in prices, when you are looking at the chart of something that is a currency or a company stock - really very much most often the value of any real thing will not change 100% overnight.

The technical analysis play for this principle can be translated into an indicator like bbands, which in very simple terms is a median price wrapped in its standard deviations. If the price action wanders out of the standard deviations boundary, it will most often be just about the time it starts wandering back inside - unless something nonstandard is happening. Looking at overbought and oversold areas at RSIs and similar oscillators is the same idea.

Technical Trading as Relying on History

Another aspect are historical levels that form support/resistance areas.

The idea behind this focus of technical analysis is not guessing that the price is likely to do the same thing at the price level that is being revisited, the roots of support and resistance are in the basic supply/demand logic.

If there is a price level that has been clearly perceived as “too expensive” since the history shows that used to be a lot of selling at one or more points in the past, then the demand will most likely weaken around that level again in the future, and that for so long until something outside of technical analysis changes.

In some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin you could start talking about the halving here: If the supply of the asset decreases and at the same time the demand for it doesn’t decrease, at some point this will lead to rise in prices. On the charts, this will render as breaking up through a resistance zone.

The breaking up through resistance or breaking down through support can also be fully and completely a result of speculation, though. It is important to keep in mind that the price action on the charts is really just a result of the many forces acting on the market, not the gospel that defines the truth. Assets can be undervalued, assets can be overvalued.

And then there’s the one last thing to this: Support and resistance is such a popular technical analysis principle that it already takes us to the last aspect:


  TA is a protocol for traders to implicitly coordinate their activities, using price history as the communications medium. u/dasignint on Reddit


Technical Trading as Relying on… Technical Trading

Especially with the rare and joyful events, like when a market is making new highs and so there is no history to account for, it’s time to shine for tools like Fibonacci, known most often as “fibs”. Fibs use obscure formulas which probably border on abuse of mathematics to project price levels where the future reversals are likely to occur.

How is that useful?

Short-term traders, and there are always many, like to flow with the market in both directions. This means that they do not want to risk missing a retracement, even if a short one.

This particular type of a trader would normally look at support and resistance levels to mark for themselves the price levels where the action is likely to reverse. When they do not have resistance levels available, because the market is trending above the all-time-highs, they will use fibs.

As long as there is no new information shaking up the market, the reversal will often actually happen around the fib level, because this is the easiest and most accessible tool for people to determine a price level where they will set their take-profit orders to scale out of their positions and minimize their risk.

The profit-taking will slow down the trend and that in turn will catch the attention even of those traders who might not even know what “fibs” are.

Consequently, very often the fib will happen as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.

When Technical Analysis Doesn’t Work

If there is an unexpected important event happening, it will always shake up the markets, no matter how mature and stable they are: China bans Bitcoin? Of course. How about China banning the US Dollar, though? Of course there would be a shake-up too!

With some cryptocurrencies, the important event can be something far more prosaic, though.

Back in the day when BTC was popular enough to have semi-pro trading platforms but at the same time was still really a niche thing, the daily play was to leverage the fact that the market was small enough for people with maybe five digits USD to move it and literally buy their way.

Such a thing is still possible, there is also mostly no legal danger in doing so, because cryptocurrencies are unregulated markets.

The only thing that changed here is the amount of money and skill to paint the market the way you want it.

That is a fact and because of this technical analysis can always fail.

As a resource for your technical analysis, here is a list of the best cryptocurrency trading indicators
that generally work for smaller-cap cryptocurrencies too, while you can still use them for Bitcoin as well.


  Fibonacci - as explained above, used to determine the most likely levels for price reversals, especially when it is not possible to draw support and resistance lines based on history because the price is making all-time-highs.
  For trending crypto markets, Ichimoku cloud is invaluable - this is an article with a ton of videos and resources
  Divergences - only used to establish a level where you should be looking for an entry, not precise enough to be a signal to enter.

&lt;p&gt;If there is a price level that has been clearly perceived as “too expensive” since the history shows that used to be a lot of selling at one or more points in the past, then the demand will most likely weaken around that level again in the future, and that for so long until something outside of technical analysis changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin you could start talking about the halving here: If the supply of the asset decreases and at the same time the demand for it doesn’t decrease, at some point this will lead to rise in prices. On the charts, this will render as breaking up through a resistance zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The breaking up through resistance or breaking down through support can also be fully and completely a result of speculation, though.&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to keep in mind that the price action on the charts is really just a result of the many forces acting on the market, not the gospel that defines the truth. Assets can be undervalued, assets can be overvalued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the one last thing to this: Support and resistance is such a popular technical analysis principle that it already takes us to the last aspect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TA is a protocol for traders to implicitly coordinate their activities, using price history as the communications medium. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7vnm87/psa_technical_analysis_is_a_madeup_term_to_hide/dttvtdg/&quot;&gt;u/dasignint on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;technical-trading-as-relying-on-technical-trading&quot;&gt;Technical Trading as Relying on… Technical Trading&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially with the rare and joyful events, like when a market is making new highs and so there is no history to account for, it’s time to shine for tools like &lt;a href=&quot;/strategy/fibs&quot;&gt;Fibonacci, known most often as “fibs”&lt;/a&gt;. Fibs use obscure formulas which probably border on abuse of mathematics to project price levels where the future reversals are likely to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is that useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short-term traders, and there are always many, like to flow with the market in both directions. This means that they do not want to risk missing a retracement, even if a short one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular type of a trader would normally look at support and resistance levels to mark for themselves the price levels where the action is likely to reverse. When they do not have resistance levels available, because the market is trending above the all-time-highs, they will use fibs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as there is no new information shaking up the market, the reversal will &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; actually happen around the fib level, because this is the easiest and most accessible tool for people to determine a price level where they will set their take-profit orders to scale out of their positions and minimize their risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The profit-taking will slow down the trend and that in turn will catch the attention even of those traders who might not even know what “fibs” are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, &lt;em&gt;very often&lt;/em&gt; the fib will happen as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-technical-analysis-doesnt-work&quot;&gt;When Technical Analysis Doesn’t Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is an unexpected important event happening, it will always shake up the markets, no matter how mature and stable they are: China bans Bitcoin? Of course. How about China banning the US Dollar, though? Of course there would be a shake-up too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some cryptocurrencies, the important event can be something far more prosaic, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day when BTC was popular enough to have semi-pro trading platforms but at the same time was still really a niche thing, the daily play was to leverage the fact that the market was small enough for people with maybe five digits USD to move it and literally buy their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a thing is still possible, there is also mostly no legal danger in doing so, because cryptocurrencies are unregulated markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that changed here is the amount of money and skill to paint the market the way you want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is a fact and because of this technical analysis can always fail&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Daytrading on Crypto Markets: Good Idea? ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Daytrading means entering and exiting the market in a single day. Is this a good crypto trading strategy? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Daytrading is quite a broad term for the style of trading that has you enter and exit the market during a single trading session, preferably in profit.

You can be a daytrader if you engage in scalping crypto, most types of arbitrage also fall into daytrading but you can in fact aim for larger swings on the crypto markets that will need several hours to develop.

In the latter case, the border between swing trading and day trading gets a little blurry, since bitcoin market hours are 24/7/365.

You probably get the idea, though: You daytrade crypto when you flip in and out of a position within a few hours.

Daytrading in crypto: The Psychology Aspect

Daytrading crypto is indeed possible, but be aware that it is really a good fit only to some type of personalities.


  If you daytrade, you need to sit down glued to the chart until your trade reaches completion.
  Oh yeah, you need to actually have this planned quite strategically: What do you do in every possible market structure - close, wait, stop, take profit. There isn’t room for emotion or hesitating.
  There was the magic word: Stop-Loss. You will probably want to use automatic stop loss, which means you will get stop-hunted. So if you are looking for a personal development project, try building up your strength of character to such level that you will be able to quit a losing trade without automatic stop, just on alert.


Aside from the psychology of the trader which must be compatible with this style of trade execution, let’s now look at some basic rules of the job.

Go for smaller profits

If you want to close your position as soon as possible and with profit, don’t look for huge profit from every single trade.

You might find those in illiquid markets, such as when a new coin is released with much hype and the trading just opens, or in market squeezes, when there is a liquidation cascade. In both cases, those are short-lived.

Choose a deeper market

If you see a high-volume breakout on the bitcoin market, check your favorite TA indicators and decide to either buy or stay out. On BTC/fiat markets your order will fill without hurdles and you will make it safely out too when you want to, at least if you’re trading on reliable outfits and not on a tiny obscure crypto exchange.

If you see a surprise parabolic growth on a small altcoin market, remember that the chances of it catching on are next to nothing, so don’t give in to FOMO. If you buy emotionally during what traders call “pump”, there might not be enough sellers later if the market is too thin for that particular cryptocurrency. The worst case scenario is getting stuck with a bag of altcoin that slowly dies out and eventually gets delisted from the exchange.


  Don’t make excuses for being stuck with your past mistakes.


To put it in simple terms, most altcoin markets are simply not deep enough for technical daytrading. If you are okay with speculating on an incoming pump, you might be successful here and there, but that’s more similar to gambling than to trading. Technical daytrading for smaller profits is safer on big markets like BTC/fiat or ETH/fiat.

Daytrading is the technical and strategic legwork and it also means you don’t want to hold that altcoin for months of years, so don’t use that as an excuse for being stuck in your past gambles.

Choose a reliable exchange

If you are only interested in altcoins with larger markets, go for trading outfits that used to be known as “bitcoin” exchanges.


  Bitfinex trades ETH, ETC, XMR, DASH, ZEC…
  Kraken trades ETH, LTC, XRP, ZEC, XMR…


For new launches, you might find quite some on Bitfinex these days, but generally the thinner market plays concentrate on places like YoBit and BitTrex.

If you want to daytrade derivatives, your only liquid crypto futures option in 2019 is still BitMEX.

Charting

For your crypto daytrading chart analysis needs, TradingView FREE Account will be enough unless you need timespans shorter than one minute.

Summary

Daytrading in the technical sense is indeed possible on cryptocurrency markets.

It is an emotionally exhausting and time-intensive work though, therefore it is not a good fit for every crypto trader.

If you still want to give daytrading a shot, you should pay attention to the choice of markets with which you’ll engage (you might find the Wyckoff avoidance strategy useful) and to what tools and platforms you’ll be using.

        <description><![CDATA[ Wyckoff method of avoidance means to trade only the best stocks in the leading sectors. How to apply this motto when trading cryptocurrencies? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Wyckoff method is getting popular in the cryptocurrency space mainly because John Bollinger the author of bbands keeps recommending it on twitter.

While it is a method that has been used heavily on legacy stock markets through a good part of the 20th century, there is no doubt it is useful for crypto as well. The versatility of the Wyckoff method lies in it being so fundamental that it is applicable in most market conditions, as far as they can be analyzed technically.

@kenzboard @MrJozza Yeah, Wyckoff is as near to a universal key to understanding trading as we have.&amp;mdash; John Bollinger (@bbands) 24 February 2017

 --- [ article continues after ad ] --- 


Wyckoff avoidance is the value trading

In simple terms, the Wyckoff avoidance method means to trade only the best assets in the leading market sectors.

Crypto is an emerging asset class, but there are already ways of determining which cryptocurrency has fundamental value. Focusing on the opportunities in those markets makes your decisions process much clearer:


  You want to buy/hold a fundamentally valuable asset when its price is not reflecting its value yet.
  You want to take profits and abandon an asset that is appreciating in the short term because of things like tiny market inefficiency or news hype.


Altcoin Trading Strategy: How strong a coin is

From StockCharts, talking about trading legacy stocks with Wyckoff avoidance method:


  The Wyckoffian mission is to trade and invest in the best stocks in the leading Industry Groups. We have been studying examples of leadership characteristics using Wyckoff Analysis in combination with relative strength [of industry assets as compared with one another]. Always be seeking the strongest stocks in the strongest groups [but also] study the asset groups that are stalling and falling from favor.


The key point is that a leader of an asset group does not stay the leader forever.

At some point the leader leaves the limelight, becomes a laggard and may stay a laggard for some time. That’s where the Wyckoff avoidance strategy brings a lot of use even for your Hodl stash and long term trades that need periodic re-evaluation. If you spot the transition of a leader to a laggard you are still left with heaps of time to gradually exit the market and decide on your next move.

Finding the market weakness

You can use any of your favorite technical analysis tools that are good for spotting the weakness of a market - divergences would be a very early sign (and possibly a misleading one) but combined with a three-push formation and lower highs when seen relative to the Bollinger bands would be more reliable.

The general technical gist is that this transition is a substantial one, you should be looking for it on longer timeframes (daily, 3D or weekly charts). The market structure will be similar in all assets in the group you are looking at, but the weakening leader would display the crumbling more strongly.

Select assets that are in harmony with the market

Another important point in Wyckoff avoidance is to select assets that move in harmony with the market. The bigger picture and relations between different assets of the same class is often overlooked, but it is incredibly useful also for market timing.

In terms of Wyckoff avoidance, the rule boils down simply to the following:


  In a bull (uptrend) market, select [assets] that are stronger than the market itself. In a bear market choose those that are weaker than the market itself.


Assuming we are in a broad crypto bull market, if you can find cryptocurrencies that are performing consistently strong and if you can also find their counterparts, you have your best candidates for your long and short positions:


  Strong cryptoassets rally quite easily. After the rally comes a retrace, but some of the gains remain.
  Weak cryptoassets don’t rally consistently. If they do, the retrace kills all the gains.


On legacy markets, it is easy to compare an asset against a composite index: In a bull market, if an asset trades still well below a known resistance line and gains more than the index, it’s typically the strong performer.

The play there is to buy this particular asset, avoiding all the rest of the assets in its group.

The technically suggested time to sell comes when the price approaches a resistance area. Then you can look which stock was performing poorly in the rally: It’s is going to be the one that should drop the most in the coming retrace and therefore it is technically the best candidate for a short.

We now also have composite indexes in cryptocurrency markets, but the information you can get from them is still fairly questionable. Remember, the crypto markets are still very new. More on crypto indexes in our Strategy article about market timing.

Going back to individual coins

To find the inceptions of changes in the market, you will have to go back to individual cryptocurrencies and look for topping patterns and reversals.

If you are a trading beginner, you can use free charting tools like Cryptowatch or TradingView, get a BTCUSD chart with Parabolic SAR, RSI and MACD indicators and go backwards to learn how past trend reversals looked. Then you can compare it with what ETHUSD was doing in that time, and then perhaps XRPUSD and smaller altcoins.

The hourly bitcoin chart below shows Parabolic SAR set to 0.025, 0.02, 0.03 on TradingView. If you click on the picture to zoom it you’ll see it flipping, and if you look at the RSI at the bottom you’ll see a divergence between the RSI lows and the price lows, which is bullish as it shows the lows are too low for the strength of the market.



When technical analysis fails

From a 2017 Financial Times article (archived link without paywall), most likely about the OKEx futures exchange:

“Daniel Masters, the founder of one of the world’s first bitcoin funds – Jersey-based Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Program (GABI) – is calling for position limits on bitcoin exchanges, after falling prey to a heinous case of cash-to-futures basis manipulation in February, when bitcoin soared to new record high.

Our position was liquidated at $767 and, needless to say, by the time we were back in the market the price was shooting back above $900. This was of course an extremely unfortunate state of affairs in which to find ourselves and a hard lesson learned. Accordingly, we lost around 10% of performance against our benchmark, the USD price of bitcoin.

The matters set out above highlighted another issue with bitcoin trading, which up until this point we had not considered. After the price drop, one player emerged as totally dominant in the open interest of the futures contract.

It seemed pretty clear to us as a result that this event was not just a normal version of a large liquidation, with which we are familiar, but was a premeditated attack. When the dust settled, one unidentified player was short well over half the open interest.

We would therefore class this episode as clear market manipulation, and in fact it was not just momentary: for many days thereafter the basis was so weak that it seemed that the one attack was being followed up by periodic smaller attacks.

As such we approached the exchange. They confirmed to us that there were no position limits whatsoever and that people were free to do whatever they wanted in their “happy trading environment” (yes, they used those actual words). We made it very clear that such activity, whether in a regulated environment or not, might amount to criminality in Hong Kong and would certainly do so in many other jurisdictions.

Following a number of discussions, the exchange encouraged the ‘rogue’ player to withdraw and things have now normalized.”

So, as a last note: Don’t be naive. Of course it’s happening.

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Wyckoff method is getting popular in the cryptocurrency space mainly because John Bollinger the author of bbands keeps recommending it on twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is a method that has been used heavily on legacy stock markets through a good part of the 20th century, there is no doubt it is useful for crypto as well. The versatility of the Wyckoff method lies in it being so fundamental that it is applicable in most market conditions, as far as they can be analyzed technically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kenzboard&quot;&gt;@kenzboard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MrJozza&quot;&gt;@MrJozza&lt;/a&gt; Yeah, Wyckoff is as near to a universal key to understanding trading as we have.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; John Bollinger (@bbands) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bbands/status/835170564431962112&quot;&gt;24 February 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wyckoff-avoidance-is-the-value-trading&quot;&gt;Wyckoff avoidance is the value trading&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the Wyckoff avoidance method means to trade only the best assets in the leading market sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto is an emerging asset class, but there are already ways of determining which cryptocurrency has &lt;a href=&quot;/value/&quot;&gt;fundamental value&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing on the opportunities in those markets makes your decisions process much clearer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to buy/hold a fundamentally valuable asset when its price is not reflecting its value yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to take profits and abandon an asset that is appreciating in the short term because of things like tiny market inefficiency or news hype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;altcoin-trading-strategy-how-strong-a-coin-is&quot;&gt;Altcoin Trading Strategy: How strong a coin is&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://stockcharts.com/articles/wyckoff/2017/02/avoidance-strategy.html&quot;&gt;StockCharts&lt;/a&gt;, talking about trading legacy stocks with Wyckoff avoidance method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Wyckoffian mission is to trade and invest in the best stocks in the leading Industry Groups. We have been studying examples of leadership characteristics using &lt;strong&gt;Wyckoff Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; in combination with &lt;strong&gt;relative strength&lt;/strong&gt; [of industry assets as compared with one another]. Always be seeking the &lt;strong&gt;strongest stocks in the strongest groups&lt;/strong&gt; [but also] study the asset groups that are stalling and falling from favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key point is that a leader of an asset group does not stay the leader forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point the leader leaves the limelight, becomes a laggard and may stay a laggard for some time. That’s where the Wyckoff avoidance strategy brings a lot of use even for your &lt;a href=&quot;/strategy/crypto-investment&quot;&gt;Hodl stash and long term trades that need periodic re-evaluation&lt;/a&gt;. If you spot the transition of a leader to a laggard you are still left with heaps of time to gradually exit the market and decide on your next move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-the-market-weakness&quot;&gt;Finding the market weakness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use any of your favorite technical analysis tools that are good for spotting the weakness of a market - divergences would be a very early sign (and possibly a misleading one) but combined with a three-push formation and lower highs when seen relative to the Bollinger bands would be more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general technical gist is that this transition is a substantial one, you should be looking for it on longer timeframes (daily, 3D or weekly charts). The market structure will be similar in all assets in the group you are looking at, but the weakening leader would display the crumbling more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;select-assets-that-are-in-harmony-with-the-market&quot;&gt;Select assets that are in harmony with the market&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important point in Wyckoff avoidance is to select assets that move in harmony with the market. The bigger picture and relations between different assets of the same class is often overlooked, but it is incredibly useful also for &lt;a href=&quot;/strategy/timing&quot;&gt;market timing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of Wyckoff avoidance, the rule boils down simply to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;strong&gt;bull (uptrend) market&lt;/strong&gt;, select [assets] that are &lt;strong&gt;stronger than the market itself&lt;/strong&gt;. In a bear market choose those that are weaker than the market itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming we are in a broad crypto bull market, if you can find cryptocurrencies that are performing consistently strong and if you can also find their counterparts, you have your best candidates for your long and short positions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strong cryptoassets rally quite easily. After the rally comes a retrace, but some of the gains remain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weak cryptoassets don’t rally consistently. If they do, the retrace kills all the gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On legacy markets, it is easy to compare an asset against a composite index: In a bull market, if an asset trades still well below a known resistance line and gains more than the index, it’s typically the strong performer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The play there is to buy this particular asset, avoiding all the rest of the assets in its group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technically suggested time to sell comes when the price approaches a resistance area. Then you can look which stock was performing poorly in the rally: It’s is going to be the one that should drop the most in the coming retrace and therefore it is technically the best candidate for a short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now also have composite indexes in cryptocurrency markets, but the information you can get from them is still fairly questionable. Remember, the crypto markets are still very new. &lt;a href=&quot;/strategy/timing#using-the-crypto-indexes&quot;&gt;More on crypto indexes in our Strategy article about market timing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;going-back-to-individual-coins&quot;&gt;Going back to individual coins&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the inceptions of changes in the market, you will have to go back to individual cryptocurrencies and look for topping patterns and reversals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a trading beginner, you can use free charting tools like &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cryptowat.ch&quot;&gt;Cryptowatch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://tradingview.go2cloud.org/SHW9&quot;&gt;TradingView&lt;/a&gt;, get a BTCUSD chart with Parabolic SAR, RSI and MACD indicators and go backwards to learn how past trend reversals looked. Then you can compare it with what ETHUSD was doing in that time, and then perhaps XRPUSD and smaller altcoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hourly bitcoin chart below shows Parabolic SAR set to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.025, 0.02, 0.03&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;a class=&quot;external&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://tradingview.go2cloud.org/SHW9&quot;&gt;TradingView&lt;/a&gt;. If you click on the picture to zoom it you’ll see it flipping, and if you look at the RSI at the bottom you’ll see a divergence between the RSI lows and the price lows, which is bullish as it shows the lows are too low for the strength of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;when-technical-analysis-fails&quot;&gt;When technical analysis fails&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/03/08/2185731/when-otc-markets-backfire-bitcoin-edition/&quot;&gt;Financial Times article&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/aQ7Om&quot;&gt;(archived link without paywall)&lt;/a&gt;, most likely about the OKEx futures exchange:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Daniel Masters, the founder of one of the world’s first bitcoin funds – Jersey-based Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Program (GABI) – is calling for position limits on bitcoin exchanges, after falling prey to a heinous case of cash-to-futures basis manipulation in February, when bitcoin soared to new record high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our position was liquidated at $767 and, needless to say, by the time we were back in the market the price was shooting back above $900. This was of course an extremely unfortunate state of affairs in which to find ourselves and a hard lesson learned. Accordingly, we lost around 10% of performance against our benchmark, the USD price of bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The matters set out above highlighted another issue with bitcoin trading, which up until this point we had not considered. After the price drop, one player emerged as totally dominant in the open interest of the futures contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed pretty clear to us as a result that this event was not just a normal version of a large liquidation, with which we are familiar, but was a premeditated attack. When the dust settled, one unidentified player was short well over half the open interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would therefore class this episode as clear market manipulation, and in fact it was not just momentary: for many days thereafter the basis was so weak that it seemed that the one attack was being followed up by periodic smaller attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such we approached the exchange. They confirmed to us that there were no position limits whatsoever and that people were free to do whatever they wanted in their “happy trading environment” (yes, they used those actual words). We made it very clear that such activity, whether in a regulated environment or not, might amount to criminality in Hong Kong and would certainly do so in many other jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a number of discussions, the exchange encouraged the ‘rogue’ player to withdraw and things have now normalized.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, as a last note: Don’t be naive. Of course it’s happening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description><![CDATA[ Are you better off trading bitcoin or forex? Ultimately, it’s about picking the battles, and the right trading strategy. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ “Should I move from forex market to crypto?” This has been one of the most common questions asked by forex traders, especially since the boom of cryptocurrencies in late 2017.

The year 2017 meant a breakthrough for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Along with the wild changes in prices on the market, the business of crypto trading grew accordingly.

The years 2018 and 2019 saw the opposite move: Crypto traders bored with ranging market going nowhere started venturing into forex, oil and other legacy markets.

One thing remains though: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies moved from a niche curiosity propped by obscure online forums to the radar of everybody who invests or trades on the markets.

The Difference between Forex and Crypto Market

If you were previously fx trading, cryptocurrencies in their early stage probably weren’t attractive to you. You were used to the access to hundreds of forex pairs across majors, minors, exotics and metals. There was enough fun.

If you out of curiosity still made the decision to sample the trading of Bitcoin, other leading leading or even emerging altcoins, you must have noticed how different even the most mature among the crypto markets are from forex.

In the next section we’ll be comparing the differences, pros and cons of forex and crypto trading to help you make an informed decision on your trading future.

If instead of that you want to delve deeper into the technical analysis tools crypto traders like to use, here is a few options:


  Ichimoku Cloud: The indicator was adopted from stock market for crypto markets that don’t close for the weekends, and so Ichimoku Cloud as an indicator that works with timespans often gets used with crypto-specific settings.
  Wyckoff trading: Wyckoff method is used in stock markets rather than in forex trading because they tend to have stronger directional trends with the occasional range, and at least until this point cryptocurrencies have been similar in that. To a technical forex trader, learning about Wyckoff could be quite useful.
  Orderbook heatmaps &amp;amp; Co: On the contrary to Wyckoff, scalping in crypto will be in some way similar to the gist of fast-paced forex trading. In crypto though, we have better and more accessible advanced tools for short-term trading strategies.


Forex vs. Bitcoin and Crypto Trading

Just in case you are entirely new to the concept of cryptocurrencies, these refer to a medium of digital assets that utilize algorithms and cryptography to generate and verify transactions of value.

Some cryptoassets are used primarily as money, some primarily as technical platforms.

Nonetheless, even in 2019 the crypto market is still not evolved and stratified enough to make it reasonable to consider altcoin markets separately from bitcoin markets.

Crypto Trading: Pros and Cons


  pros



  The gains. We might as well face it that the gains some people made on the crypto markets from a tiny starting bank would be extremely unlikely to ever happen in forex. Trading cryptocurrencies has been a lucrative proposition for investors that know the right time to enter and exit the markets. However, remember that there have been just as many losses.
  The same level of leverage as in forex, except on markets with far more pronounced moves. Leveraged trading can cause a lot of damage. On the other hand, the completely free accessibility of leverage up to 100x on platforms like BitMEX that don’t even require you to state your name open up a host of possibilities. You can open straddle positions or set up risk-free collecting of swap funding payments. Remember that you need to have discipline and keep your cool though.
  Availability of lending. Staying with the previous points, the range of the possibilities depends on your location but in general you can decide to lend your crypto or fiat currencies in a more or less unregulated way. The lack of regulation also means lower costs of running business because there is less need for lawyers and insurers, and therefore the trading fees and other costs that eat from your profits are lower than on regulated markets.



  cons



  Lack of historical data. Cryptocurrency markets are very new, their valuation has been changing explosively in both directions and excluding peer-to-peer, during the first few years crypto trading was isolated to a single trading platform. For anyone trying to backtest a trading algo or just learn about typical market patterns, there is not enough historical data to use as key support and resistance levels.
  Cryptocurrencies are more volatile. Some traders like price volatility - some even trade volatility rather than price direction. But some might say that cryptocurrencies are too volatile and it’s an almighty challenge to find suitable entry and exit points.
  Strong influence of the unpredictable market sentiment. Cryptos were on an uptrend in 2017 and then they  swapped to a downtrend in 2018. This rather normal occurrence had many call the end of cryptocurrencies, not to mention the endless news about which country is trying to ban crypto again this week.


Forex Trading: Pros and Cons


  pros



  24-hour accessibility on work days. Forex traders can enjoy 24-hour access to all forex pairs with real-time pricing, charts and tools during the work week. In many ways it can be good to have a weekend, if only to plan with a clear head what to do on  market open.
  Market leverage. Forex has been known for tight ranges and therefore the widespread use of leverage to maximize trading profits. Common forex leverages are up to 100x, depending on your broker.
  Unrivaled liquidity. The forex market is undoubtedly the most liquid market in financial trading; it is the easiest market to open and close positions with speed.



  cons



  Forex is not ideal for smaller trading banks. In truth, the forex market is largely made up of hedge funds and trading groups. Given the small percentage moves on forex pairs, you need a sizable trading bank to generate respectable returns.
  Unpredictable volatility. Forex markets are called “legacy” which implies something stable, but they can be just as volatile as cryptocurrency markets. Indeed there are moments of extreme volatility in forex, particularly surrounding political events.


Comparing the Opportunities on Forex and Crypto Markets

In truth, there is a place for crypto and forex trading in all our trading arsenals. Do not expect to come from forex markets, apply your usual forex trading strategy in crypto, walk away with millions after a week and retire early.

Crypto markets are different from forex markets, even though cryptos are also currencies.

On the other hand, non-directional strategies that minimize your risk are available far more easily and at less costs on the crypto markets - it is just human nature that this lack of constraints also attracts foolish risking.

Ultimately, it’s about picking the right battles and knowing the right time to use them when the risk factors are on your side.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24-hour accessibility on work days&lt;/strong&gt;. Forex traders can enjoy 24-hour access to all forex pairs with real-time pricing, charts and tools during the work week. In many ways it can be good to have a weekend, if only to plan with a clear head what to do on  market open.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market leverage.&lt;/strong&gt; Forex has been known for tight ranges and therefore the widespread &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/07/forex_leverage.asp&quot;&gt;use of leverage&lt;/a&gt; to maximize trading profits. Common forex leverages are up to 100x, depending on your broker.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unrivaled liquidity.&lt;/strong&gt; The forex market is undoubtedly the most liquid market in financial trading; it is the easiest market to open and close positions with speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;cons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forex is not ideal for smaller trading banks.&lt;/strong&gt; In truth, the forex market is largely made up of hedge funds and trading groups. Given the small percentage moves on forex pairs, you need a sizable trading bank to generate respectable returns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpredictable volatility.&lt;/strong&gt; Forex markets are called “legacy” which implies something stable, but they can be just as volatile as cryptocurrency markets. Indeed there are moments of extreme volatility in forex, particularly surrounding political events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparing-the-opportunities-on-forex-and-crypto-markets&quot;&gt;Comparing the Opportunities on Forex and Crypto Markets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In truth, there is a place for crypto and forex trading in all our trading arsenals.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not expect to come from forex markets, apply your usual forex trading strategy in crypto, walk away with millions after a week and retire early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto markets are different from forex markets, even though cryptos are also currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, non-directional strategies that minimize your risk are available far more easily and at less costs on the crypto markets - it is just human nature that this lack of constraints also attracts foolish risking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimately, it’s about picking the right battles and knowing the right time to use them when the risk factors are on your side.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description><![CDATA[ Arguably the core of 'be your own bank' principle - How did crypto wallets evolve and what are the features you're looking for, as a trader? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ What would we do without crypto wallets? They keep our coins safe and untouchable, without them holding cryptocurrencies wouldn’t make sense.

Since the inception of Bitcoin, wallets have always been an integral part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

 --- article continues after advertisement --- 

How else would you be your own bank?

People who are only in crypto for the investment might be blind to it, but the following is a simple fact: Should we be interested in such a thing, crypto wallets can be our own personal banks.

Nonetheless, it’s 2019. There are banks that store crypto for their clients - providing cryptocurrency custody service for them, and to most of their clients it will seem that the concept of personal storage is somewhat unnecessary. After all, it is like in every line of commerce: Someone charges a fee for making a complex thing simple to handle.

You know what they say though - Not your keys, not your coin. Letting someone else take care of your cryptocurrency introduces the element of trust into crypto, and if this were sensible, we wouldn’t have cryptocurrencies at all because everyone would be perfectly happy with fiat.

Good news is that just like cryptocurrency custody providers make “having” crypto easier, crypto wallet developers are likewise making it easier to manage your coins yourself. That reaches from simplistic usability for the wallet you use every day from your phone to advanced anonymizing tools for coins that are not inherently private.

In short, there are now so many different types of crypto wallets - wallets that each can serve a specific role in our trading journey.

The evolution of crypto wallets

Crypto wallets have evolved a lot throughout the years and they have become safer, more flexible, and more personalized.

All the crypto wallet drainage: The human factor

One early type of crypto wallets were so-called brainwallets.

These days, when you’re setting up a new wallet via its software, you get a random 12-24 seed phrase generated for you. Essentially, you could have a brain wallet do the same thing - but you would have to come up with that seed yourself. Most people would instead have their brainwallet generated from a simple phrase - the name brainwallet refers to the concept of memorizing your seed rather than writing it down on a piece of paper. Once this became a known fact, there was a wave of bruteforce attacks.

By now, probably all of these primitive brainwallets have been drained by hackers. They are one of the reasons why people who weren’t in crypto would be convinced that “crypto always gets stolen”, or some other similar blanket statement. Today’s crypto wallet landscape is far safer though, simply because it doesn’t leave the crucial task of seed generation to humans.

Crypto wallets by their purpose

There are a couple different kinds of crypto wallets out there:

Paper wallet - For this kind of wallet, your private keys and public addresses are printed on a piece of paper. If you can physically manage the paper, this will be your safest storage option that doesn’t even require a lot of technical skill. It is not feasible to use a paper wallet for daily transactions though.

Hardware wallet - These wallets are actual physical devices that are built specifically for handling private keys and public addresses. It’s probably the most secure kind of crypto wallet for the regular crypto investor who is not skilled to homelab their own air-gapped crypto storage. For now, crypto hardware wallet producers still do not care too much about the sourcing of the hardware, and even if they did, us traders would still only need to take their word for it.

Software bugs and vulnerabilities in hardware wallets get discovered several times each year but generally, the criminal activity in crypto stealing focuses on much far lower hanging fruit. That makes hardware wallets very reasonable safe. Hardware wallets are usable enough for regular transactions, although not extremely convenient.

Desktop wallets - These are wallets that you can download via software packs. There are tons of these available for all operating systems - Mac, Windows, Linux, etc. They are very easy to use, but exposed to every piece of malicious or spying code that your laptop might contract from adverts or videos during common web browsing.

Mobile wallets - These are applications that people can download on their smartphones. They are ideal for smaller transactions on-the-go, or as a transit place for an exchange withdrawal which will eventually go to a hardware wallet.

If you are a trader, a combination of a mobile app wallet and a hardware wallet is currently the best compromise for both usability and security.

Web wallets - The least secure way of storing crypto. You can use web browsers to access these wallets, and in some cases you do not even get to own your private keys. Having your crypto in a web wallet that keeps your private key is equivalent to leaving the coin on an exchange.


  In crypto, security should always be your top priority.


When it comes to cryptocurrency trading, you should always really, really, really think twice before leaving your money on an exchange just because you’re too lazy to withdraw them.

Just pick a mobile wallet and a hardware wallet and if it’s only slightly doable for you, transact from devices that you don’t use on a daily basis to limit your exposure to malware.

The next thing would be to always consider how secure your wallet (still) is and how you can even make it more secure. After all, these are the things that hold all our money.

These are the questions to ask yourself:


  Is the development and testing active?
  Is there a community on Reddit or elsewhere around the wallet?
  Crypto wallets are a black box, unless you’re a security researcher: Who are the devs? Do they have any reputation at all? How long have they been around?


Of course, always be sure to enable all security measures like setting a strong password and enabling 2-Factor Authentication.

Good wallets on the market?

There are tons of different wallets to explore out there but I’ve rounded up three wallets that seem to be the best at what kind of wallet they are.

Trezor

Trezor is probably the most user-friendly hardware wallet around, even though in terms of popularity it loses to Ledger. Trezor works with multiple currencies and also works as a password manager as well as a two-factor authentication device. The device has a failsafe for lost passwords and lost devices (but you should probably still be extra careful that this does not happen).

Electrum

One of the oldest and most highly regarded desktop wallets, Electrum is available for download on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Android. It has the ability to work with some physical wallets and offers a great deal of flexibility.

Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin wallet where the lightweight means you don’t need to download the whole blockchain - Electrum has its own network of trusted nodes. That is a convenience but also a limitation, as the Electrum node network was under a severe DDoS attack through April 2019.

Blockchain.com

Formerly Blockchain.info, this is one of the more secure crypto wallet services that are accessible through a web browser. It currently supports BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC and XLM only and comes with a pretty convenient smartphone app. The app has a bunch of advanced security features that you won’t find in more popular wallet apps - think IP whitelisting, fingerprint access and such. They’ll nag you about verifying your real world identity though, so you will have to proceed with caution if privacy is important to you.

Where now?


  If you’re looking to buy a commercial hardware wallet, there are discount offers throughout the year. We keep the good ones listed here.

        <title><![CDATA[ How to Compare the Fundamental Value of Cryptoassets ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Guide on how to assess the fundamental value of cryptocurrencies. Some cryptocoins serve for payments and remittance, some are dApp fuel tokens, some are quick spinoffs only used for pump and dump schemes. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ The fundamental value of a cryptocurrency is not declared by any authority, it derives from how they are used.

As the blockchain space grows though, frameworks have been developed to categorize types of cryptoassets. Even though a clear enough framework is still not in place and so the regulatory issues are probably going to stick around for a bit longer, using the classification that is already available can still help you decide whether you actually want to enter that market or not.

Types of altcoins

In 2016, when the first alt season started, the community liked to focus on differences in technology.

Namely, which technology is the most novel, disruptive or revolutionary.  Ethereum came about like this, prior to ETH there was no asset to act as a fuel for decentralized apps.

By 2018, we had hundreds of (somewhat) active cryptocurrency projects, each sporting an interesting technology tweak, but none having much practical use - perhaps with the exception of decentralized gaming.

The relative success of dApp games indicated the focus shift from the tech onto how is the tech used.

This is where we still are today: The underlying technology is secondary; it may be the best known way to implement the function of the cryptocurrency but the function is decided first.

Crypto-Money

Cryptocurrencies as means of payment

Some altcoins were developed as means of payment, in the same sense as Bitcoin was developed as means of payment.

A cryptocurrency developed as crypto-money addresses certain weaknesses of the conventional payment system.

One such issue is the inability to exchange money freely, even if it’s to an entity located in a far-away country that maybe doesn’t like your country’s president or religion.

This problem can also occur internally within a single country, in an attempt of total control over how individuals spend: Here is a comment from 2018, where an upper middle class person in Argentina received an accusation in tax fraud because the revenue office does not believe she does not have a hired house cleaner. In the context of Argentina, the idea was probably to keep people from getting rid of the national currency which was on the brink of collapse at that time.

Bitcoin can address most of the payment-related issues in the fiat world.

Alternative cryptocurrencies developed for payments typically attempt, in turn, to solve one of the “weaknesses” of Bitcoin:


  Implementing full privacy to advance the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin (XMR)
  Focusing on scaling and transaction throughput (BCH, EOS, XRP)
  Lowering the energy consumptions of mining (PoS coins)
  Making transactions faster and cheap or even free (LTC, IOT)


Realistically, pseudonymous transactions and the transaction fee are only a problem for a subset of your normal everyday financial transactions.

Clearly XMR and full-privacy cryptocurrencies are a niche case. It is also not unreasonable to expect that BTC will be used for larger transactions, such as buying a house with Bitcoin, while tiny transactions would run on an alternative blockchain, such as ones between IoT devices.

The value of payment-focused cryptocurrencies derives from the strength of the network - traders follow metrics like network activity, number of ATMs, the size of the OTC market, payment implementations.

Interesting Crypto-Money altcoins:


  Monero


Monero is scalable and mined in a decentralized fashion because XMR mining is done via GPU which limits the usage of ASICs (application-specific circuits).

Monero payments are unlinkable, untraceable, fully anonymous and mineable on any device with a little bit of redundant computational power. That makes XMR the preferred cryptocurrency for cryptojacking, the easiest way to monetize illicit access into someone else’s device or sever.


  DASH


Dash is short for digital cash. The pivotal properties of DASH are anonymous blockchain and masternode system. The privacy system is less bulletproof than the one of Monero but the implementation of payment gateways is more widespread because implementing DASH requires less work than implementing Monero.


  Litecoin


LTC used to be the second most popular altcoin before cryptocurrencies like ETH and XRP emerged. It was created to handle massive transaction volumes but so far, it was mostly used as a guinea pig for Bitcoin blockchain innovations due to the similarity of the two. Along with DOGE, it has been since its inception used by traders to move money between exchanges for less fees.

Crypto-Fuel

Cryptocurrencies as dApp tokens

Some altcoins were developed as communication tokens: Whoever wants to engage with a decentralized app (dApp) needs to use an appropriate token to do that.

While that is still the case, on the part of the user it does not need to involve holding dozens of separate tokens since we have projects like Kyber Network that can do atomic token swaps between different tokenized assets.

Crypto tokens are still publicly traded and used for speculation.

Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, never endorsed ETH as a storage value. Why are these tokens speculated so much then? The Internet will point you to the Blue ocean Strategy.

When ETH first emerged, traders argued that crypto-fuel tokens were downplaying the monetary value of the coin on purpose: To show that it is not just another “better money”. Tokens are a new category, one that first came to existence with blockchain, and demand for this type of asset was quickly created.

The value of crypto-fuel tokens is expected to surge with the demand, but ideally with an actual (non-speculative) demand. The non-speculative demand is still awaited to arrive one day in the future though.

Interesting Crypto-Fuel altcoins:


  Ether, ERC-20 fungible tokens


Ethereum is the original blockchain for the execution of complicated smart contracts. (Simple smart contracts like an escrow can run on the Bitcoin blockchain as well.)

At first, ETH was deemed the scalable cryptocurrency with fast and cheap transactions. This view was quickly shattered when gaming dApps became popular and started flooding the blockchain with data. Then came the ICO bubble, likewise showing how easy it is to make Ethereum transactions slow and expensive.

We have since got a new generation of app-platform cryptocurrencies that focus on scalability (EOS, ZIL) and we also got the sidechain implementation which allows for existence of decentralized cryptoasset exchanges and blockchain games that do not spam the network and are free to use.

A quick note about investing into tokens: Large amount of people hold Ethereum or tokens for investment. There in infinite amount of Ether to be mined but the inflation is kept low. Some argue that after the switch to PoS the monetary value of ETH could stabilize and make a good store of value.

Crypto-Vouchers

Cryptoassets that can be exchanged for another predefined asset

Stablecoins belong to this category: They are assets living on blockchain that have a value redeemable in another asset, like IOUs.

There can be IOUs for other assets than money, though. A cryptocurrency can also be a tokenized access to service or an ecommerce gift card.

Security Tokens

The concept of utility vs security token is still new.

It is a regulatory term used for tokens that represent an investment in entrepreneurial efforts of someone else, much like investing in stocks. This type of tokens is becoming regulated because they resemble stocks, an already regulated asset.

In the concept of a “decentralized organization”, anyone can become a “shareholder” by buying a token. The work of the organization is then focused on revenue generation in whatever the company decides to call their profit unit.

The monetary value of the token changes based on the organization’s revenues.


  BitShares, DAO


BitShares was the first platform coming up with the concept of decentralized organization.

The idea later became infamous with the fall of DAO, which was hacked but the consequences of the hack were mitigated by the ETH hard fork that produced ETC.

Shitcoins

The last category of alternative cryptocurrencies are shitcoins.

It should be noted that some people will want to call perhaps EOS or Tezos a shitcoin, but they do not fall into this category.

Legitimate shitcoins are not a product of a cryptoasset project that somehow failed or disappointed, shitcoins are the cryptoassets that never had any value proposition in the first place.

We do see less of them now in the blockchain space. It is a now forgotten part of history but in 2016, the golden era of Poloniex, we did have coins that were seriously only created as an ego-blast of someone who could afford to pay the programmer. Max Keiser had his own coin, MaxCoin.

If you checked a shitcoin’s website, you would see random strings of meaningless buzzwords, such as


  Vcash was engineered to be innovative and forward-thinking. It prevents eavesdropping and censorship, promotes decentralized, energy efficient and instant network transactions. (- Taken from now defunct vanillacoin.net)


The value of shitcoins was always purely speculative. They might pump and you might be coming early enough to cash in but that’s it.

The 2017 edition of the shitcoin mania was the end of the ICO bubble - fake token sales with barely a landing page, fake LinkedIn profiles with fake names of fake team members, no plans to ever develop anything.

The actual people behind the scams would collect the crowdfunding and vanish, and like with every bubble there were some brave traders who earned good money flipping tokens of proven scams on the greater fool.

Starting from 2018 we see less of this activity - not because of regulation, but because of how crowded the gravy train of token offerings has gotten.

It is increasingly difficult to stand out just like it is increasingly difficult to pump and dump maturing cryptocurrencies.

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;The fundamental value of a cryptocurrency is not declared by any authority, it derives from how they are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the blockchain space grows though, frameworks have been developed to categorize types of cryptoassets. Even though a clear enough framework is still not in place and so the regulatory issues are probably going to stick around for a bit longer, using the classification that is already available can still help you decide whether you actually want to enter that market or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;types-of-altcoins&quot;&gt;Types of altcoins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, when the first alt season started, the community liked to focus on differences in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namely, which technology is the most novel, disruptive or revolutionary.  Ethereum came about like this, prior to ETH there was no asset to act as a fuel for decentralized apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2018, we had hundreds of (somewhat) active cryptocurrency projects, each sporting an interesting technology tweak, but none having much practical use - perhaps with the exception of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/company/markets/gaming/&quot;&gt;decentralized gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative success of dApp games indicated the focus shift from the tech onto how is the tech used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where we still are today: The underlying technology is secondary; it may be the best known way to implement the function of the cryptocurrency but the function is decided first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crypto-money&quot;&gt;Crypto-Money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrencies as means of payment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some altcoins were developed as means of payment, in the same sense as Bitcoin was developed as means of payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cryptocurrency developed as crypto-money addresses certain weaknesses of the conventional payment system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such issue is the inability to exchange money freely, even if it’s to an entity located in a far-away country that maybe doesn’t like your country’s president or religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem can also occur internally within a single country, in an attempt of total control over how individuals spend: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9cirfq/wait_now_argentina_is_in_a_full_on_currency/e5bdfut&quot;&gt;Here is a comment from 2018, where an upper middle class person in Argentina received an accusation in tax fraud because the revenue office does not believe she does not have a hired house cleaner&lt;/a&gt;. In the context of Argentina, the idea was probably to keep people from getting rid of the national currency which was on the brink of collapse at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin can address most of the payment-related issues in the fiat world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternative cryptocurrencies developed for payments typically attempt, in turn, to solve one of the “weaknesses” of Bitcoin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementing full privacy to advance the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin (XMR)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focusing on scaling and transaction throughput (BCH, EOS, XRP)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lowering the energy consumptions of mining (PoS coins)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making transactions faster and cheap or even free (LTC, IOT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically, pseudonymous transactions and the transaction fee are only a problem for a subset of your normal everyday financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly XMR and full-privacy cryptocurrencies are a niche case. It is also not unreasonable to expect that BTC will be used for larger transactions, such as &lt;a href=&quot;/openlistings-houses-for-bitcoin/&quot;&gt;buying a house with Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, while tiny transactions would run on an alternative blockchain, such as ones between IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of payment-focused cryptocurrencies derives from the strength of the network - traders follow metrics like network activity, number of ATMs, the size of the OTC market, payment implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting Crypto-Money altcoins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monero is scalable and mined in a decentralized fashion because XMR mining is done via GPU which limits the usage of ASICs (application-specific circuits).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monero payments are unlinkable, untraceable, fully anonymous and mineable on any device with a little bit of redundant computational power. That makes XMR the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/articles/cryptojacking-economic-warfare/&quot;&gt;preferred cryptocurrency for cryptojacking&lt;/a&gt;, the easiest way to monetize illicit access into someone else’s device or sever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DASH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dash is short for digital cash. The pivotal properties of DASH are anonymous blockchain and masternode system. The privacy system is less bulletproof than the one of Monero but the implementation of payment gateways is more widespread because implementing DASH requires less work than implementing Monero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Litecoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LTC used to be the second most popular altcoin before cryptocurrencies like ETH and XRP emerged. It was created to handle massive transaction volumes but so far, it was mostly used as a guinea pig for Bitcoin blockchain innovations due to the similarity of the two. Along with DOGE, it has been since its inception used by traders to move money between exchanges for less fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crypto-fuel&quot;&gt;Crypto-Fuel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrencies as dApp tokens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some altcoins were developed as communication tokens: Whoever wants to engage with a decentralized app (dApp) needs to use an appropriate token to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that is still the case, on the part of the user it does not need to involve holding dozens of separate tokens since we have &lt;a href=&quot;/etheremon-kyber-network/&quot;&gt;projects like Kyber Network that can do atomic token swaps&lt;/a&gt; between different tokenized assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto tokens are still publicly traded and used for speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, never endorsed ETH as a storage value. Why are these tokens speculated so much then? The Internet will point you to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy#Concept&quot;&gt;Blue ocean Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When ETH first emerged, traders argued that crypto-fuel tokens were downplaying the monetary value of the coin on purpose: To show that it is &lt;em&gt;not just&lt;/em&gt; another “better money”. Tokens are a new category, one that first came to existence with blockchain, and demand for this type of asset was quickly created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of crypto-fuel tokens is expected to surge with the demand, but ideally with an actual (non-speculative) demand. The non-speculative demand is still awaited to arrive one day in the future though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting Crypto-Fuel altcoins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ether, ERC-20 fungible tokens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is the original blockchain for the execution of complicated smart contracts. (Simple smart contracts like an escrow can run on the Bitcoin blockchain as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, ETH was deemed the scalable cryptocurrency with fast and cheap transactions. This view was quickly shattered when gaming dApps became popular and started flooding the blockchain with data. Then came the ICO bubble, likewise showing how easy it is to make Ethereum transactions slow and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have since got a new generation of app-platform cryptocurrencies that focus on scalability (EOS, ZIL) and we also got the sidechain implementation which allows for existence of decentralized cryptoasset exchanges and blockchain games that do not spam the network and are free to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A quick note about investing into tokens&lt;/em&gt;: Large amount of people hold Ethereum or tokens for investment. There in infinite amount of Ether to be mined but the inflation is kept low. Some argue that after the switch to PoS the monetary value of ETH could stabilize and make a good store of value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crypto-vouchers&quot;&gt;Crypto-Vouchers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptoassets that can be exchanged for another predefined asset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins belong to this category: They are assets living on blockchain that have a value redeemable in another asset, like IOUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be IOUs for other assets than money, though. A cryptocurrency can also be a tokenized access to service or an ecommerce gift card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Tokens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of utility vs security token is still new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a regulatory term used for tokens that represent an investment in entrepreneurial efforts of someone else, much like investing in stocks. This type of tokens is becoming regulated because they resemble stocks, an already regulated asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the concept of a “decentralized organization”, anyone can become a “shareholder” by buying a token. The work of the organization is then focused on revenue generation in whatever the company decides to call their profit unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monetary value of the token changes based on the organization’s revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BitShares, DAO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BitShares was the first platform coming up with the concept of decentralized organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea later became infamous with the fall of DAO, which &lt;a href=&quot;/dao-hack/&quot;&gt;was hacked&lt;/a&gt; but the consequences of the hack were mitigated by the ETH hard fork that produced ETC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shitcoins&quot;&gt;Shitcoins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last category of alternative cryptocurrencies are shitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that some people will want to call perhaps EOS or Tezos a shitcoin, but they do not fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ The feature of today’s Script Spotlight is an older tool that is not groundbreaking or super sophisticated but it will make your chart reading faster.

It is called The Detrended Price Oscillator and it is very similar to a simple moving average.

If you don’t have a TradingView account yet, make one here for free.

If you care for high leveraged trading, you’re probably looking for BitMEX as well, keep your cool though.

Detrended Price Oscillator Strategy by HPotter

Full script

//  Copyright by HPotter v1.0 30/03/2017
study(title=&quot;Detrended Price Oscillator&quot;, shorttitle=&quot;DPO&quot;)
Length = input(14, minval=1)
Series = input(title=&quot;Price&quot;, type=string, defval=&quot;close&quot;)
hline(0, color=green, linestyle=line)
xPrice = close
xsma = sma(xPrice, Length)
nRes = xPrice - xsma
pos = iff(nRes &amp;gt; 0, 1,
	     iff(nRes &amp;lt; 0, -1, nz(pos[1], 0)))
barcolor(pos == -1 ? red: pos == 1 ? green : blue )
plot(nRes, color=red, title=&quot;Detrended Price Oscillator&quot;)


Parameters: Length (number of timespans to calculate over, default 14) and Price (candle value input, default Close).

What it does: It takes the price values over the chosen span and calculates a standard moving average from them. It then calculates the difference between the price and the SMA: nRes = xPrice - xsma

The resulting line gets plotted below the chart and the chart’s candles are colored red or green depending on whether the value of the difference is positive or negative.

This is what the Detrended Price Oscillator, or DPO, looks like on a 1D BTCUSD chart. (I changed the default colors for clarity)

barcolor(pos == -1 ? orange: pos == 1 ? lime : aqua )



Does it work?

Of course it does work, there’s no rocket science in this one. You can use it on any timeframe and play with the length of the span.

On the 1W DPO gives an easy single-glance information about the market:



Even better, it is worth noting that the information you get from the color changes is equivalent to the cross of the Bollinger Band middle line on Bollinger Bands of the same length.

Here on a 1W chart for the lengths of 28:



For very long-term crypto charts this is actually more convenient that the bbands, if you are only looking for the position of the price relative to the mean.

You’ll notice I had to switch off the auto sizing on the chart because due to the periods of cryptocurrency bubbles, the lower and upper Bollinger bands shoot too far.

It won’t be a very difficult job to add candle coloring for the lower and upper Bollinger band crosses either, by the way.

Bottom Line

The Detrended Price Oscillator is indeed similar to SMAs. The information is presented by coloring the chart candles though, which means you don’t have to squint your eyes at the chart when investigating trend cycles.

A marginal advantage but if you have a chart with no candle-coloring script in place, this would be a good choice.

        <title><![CDATA[ Why Are So Many People Trading Cryptocurrency? ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ The crypto trading statistics from Google Trends show a new wave of interest in trading of digital currencies. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Cryptocurrencies might be new, but they’ve shown great potential to change our world’s future.

It’s a disruptive technology that promises outstanding returns. The small investments you put into cryptocurrency can grow into life-changing profits over a couple of years. This is the main reason why you should be interested in trading cryptocurrency.



Google Trends organic stats for “crypto trading” in US / 2019

The success of trading cryptocurrencies can only be possible if you’ve done your research and developed a good trading strategy. You should also be wise if you find some great tips on cryptocurrency trading from the internet before you start trading.

Nevertheless, do work on your good practice and don’t forget to double-check even the information shared in the following trading tips.

Here are a few reasons that we think are the major driving forces behind the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency trading.

Cryptocurrency Markets Have Higher Volatility

Volatility means the variation of the trading prices over a certain period of time. The majority of stocks in the stock market have much less volatility than cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies went through a lot of volatility because of short-term speculative interest from investors. One good example of such volatility was seen from October 2017 to October 2018, where Bitcoin’s value rose as high as $19,378 and fell down to $5,851.

The higher the volatility is, the riskier it’ll be. But this is what makes cryptocurrencies exciting and trending. Because of cryptocurrency’s high volatility, you have the chance to earn more than half of your initial investment in just a couple of days when you start trading.

The prices of cryptocurrencies are changing every minute. The rapid variations of these prices provide a lot of opportunities for traders to either go long or short when trading. This is even better for short-term swing traders or day traders because cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, tend to move from 5%-10% in just a day.

Yes, the risks are high, but if you’ve done your research and understand how to trade cryptocurrencies, you won’t mind them at all because you’re looking at the bigger picture, which is great profits.

The Volatility Of Cryptocurrencies Makes For More Trading Opportunities

This is really one of the controversial reasons why many people are trading cryptocurrency since not everyone has managed to do it successfully. There are plenty of stories around the internet about how people ploughed their entire life savings into cryptocurrencies only to lose it all.

But this will only happen if you dove into cryptocurrencies without doing your research and coming up with a good strategy. You need to be smart and cautious when trading cryptocurrencies so you can earn more money from your initial investment.

If you do it the right way, you get the chance to double or maybe even triple your earnings when you start trading cryptocurrencies. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies will make it possible for you to buy a digital currency at a low price today and sell it when its value soars up again after a couple of days.

Cryptocurrency Markets Are Available 24/7

Stock markets only open on weekdays and for a couple of hours a day. Cryptocurrency markets, on the other hand, are available 24/7 and you can access them anywhere in the world.

This is perfect for traders who have a daytime job. You can trade cryptocurrencies after going home from work or you can do it during the weekends. It’s hard for a trader with a daytime job to be active on the stock market since it only opens when most people are at work.

You can trade cryptocurrency anytime and anywhere because its market has decentralized governance. This means that it doesn’t have a single regulatory board that oversees and manages it.

This means that you don’t need to follow or comply to a schedule to make a trade since you can do it anytime of the day, making it more convenient than trading in the stock market.

No Trading Limit or “Pattern Day Trading Rule”

The pattern day trading rule is a law that prohibits you to do more than 3-day trades in 5 business days if you have less than $25,000 in your account in stock markets. This is a bit of a bummer for traders who likes to get the most out of their investments since it limits their trading activities.

But there’s no such rule observed when trading cryptocurrencies. Even if you only have $200 in your account, you can trade as many cryptocurrencies as you want every day. What this means is that if you’ve developed a strategy to trade cryptocurrencies successfully, you’ll have the potential to grow your $200 much faster than trading in stock markets.

Algo and Tech Equipment Is Not Needed

Another reason why many people are trading cryptocurrency is because of the convenience it provides. You don’t need a supercomputer with 4 monitors to start trading cryptocurrencies. You can trade crypto straight from your mobile phone.

There are many cryptocurrency exchanges or platforms out there that have a great mobile app with plenty of features and executions, which makes trading from your mobile device much easier.

The best exchange mobile apps are built around API access. That means you can for instance only allow lending in your phone app, but not trading or withdrawals. Apps built like that offer a very good level of security.

Conclusion

In today’s job market where wages get stagnant and finding a job becomes really hard, the vast majority of people would very much welcome an extra source of income. It can help take off some pressure from your bills that are piling up or treat yourself to a nice vacation - that is the main motivation behind the bulk of retail interest in trading crypto.

However, if you’re not careful when trading cryptocurrency, you may find yourself in a rough spot and eventually lose all of your investment.

Cryptocurrency trading is not a game. There’s real money for you to earn but there’s also real money for you to lose.

Do your research to improve your understanding of how the cryptocurrency market works so you can avoid the pitfalls of trading cryptocurrency.

Most people who are trading cryptocurrency are in it for the money. If done properly, it’s indeed a great way of making big money. Just be aware of the risks beforehand and always stick to a reasonable strategy.

        <title><![CDATA[ Technical Analysis: Divergences (With a Divergence Cheat Sheet) ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Divergence is a disagreement between price and an oscillating indicator such as MACD or RSI. It is not strong enough an indicator to enter a position, but it gives an idea of the state of the market. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ What are divergences in trading?

When traders talk about divergences, or divs, they are pointing out a disagreement between the price action and a technical indicator. The thing to look for in the price development are highs and lows, pick a pair of prominent ones and check if your indicator rendered the opposite thing: price made higher high, look for lower high in the indicator for that timespan.

The indicator of choice is typically some kind of oscillator (RSI, MACD).

These divergences signify prevailing momentum in the market. Depending on the type of the divergence they suggest either continuation or reversal.

Divergences in short

We distinguish regular divergence, hidden divergence and exaggerated divergence.

Regular Divergence is a sign of trend reversal. Price keeps the trend but indicator already shows the reversal.


  Signal to short = regular divergence in tops. Price makes higher high but oscillator makes lower high. Underlying weakness, possible exhaustion at the end of a bull trend.
  Signal to long = regular divergence in bottoms. Price makes lower low but oscillator makes higher low. Underlying strength, possible bottoming in progress.


Hidden Divergence is a divergence that follows the trend. Hidden divs show the market is inclined to continue the current trend.


  Signal to short = hidden divergence in tops. Price makes lower highs but oscillator makes higher highs. Tends to be found on lower highs in a downtrend.
  Signal to long = hidden divergence in bottoms. Price makes higher low but oscillator makes lower low. Tends to be found during continuation pauses in an uptrend.


Exaggerated Divergence is only different in that price makes double top or double bottom rather than new high or new low.



Divergences only show a level where to wait for entry signal

The logic behind divergences is that sometimes the indicators shows hidden tendencies of the market (strength or weakness) that might not be visible from the price action yet.

However, this is not a sharp enough indication to signal the actual entry. It gives the idea about the direction you should be looking for when looking for an entry on that timeframe but you will need to dig deeper and switch to shorter timeframes to find a plausible place for your entry.

Examples of MACD divergence, RSI divergence and %bb divergence

Price vs MACD Divergence, standard settings

This is a regular bullish divergence on an old ETHUSD chart.



Price vs StochRSI Divergence

This is a 1D chart of BTCUSD, Bitfinex. The StochRSI shows hidden bearish divergence, the momentum is set to continue the bearish trend.



Price vs %b Divergence, BBands 21 periods - stdev 3

Divergence with %b is a more precise way to observe whether new extremes of the price action are closer to or farther from the bollinger band’s boundaries. There is a more reliable version of the double bottom formation on the bbands: price makes a new low but that now is not a new low relatively to the bbands. That is to say, the first low is below the lower bband and the second low is a lower low in absolute terms (the price) but also either on or above the lower bband - video on bbands explaining that in this article.

TradingView provides the %b indicator which measures how far is the price from the bollinger band of your selected standard deviation and it plots this distance. The situation where you have new low in price but not a new low relatively to the bands shows as a regular bullish divergence on %b.

This is a 2H chart of BTCUSD, Bitfinex - the same period as the previous one on 1D. Having bearish divergences on a longer timeframe and a bullish divergence on a shorter one shows a short recovery might be in the cards but the bulls aren’t winning yet.

        <title><![CDATA[ Cryptocurrency Strategy for Beginners ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Intro to crypto strategy for beginners. Lo and behold, there is a strategy even to hodling. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Let’s face it right away.

Crypto trading is not for everyone

And it’s not just that crypto trading is not for everyone.

The truth is that many times, there is just not a good opportunity to trade.

The market is choppy, there are stop hunts, the volume is too thin.

So, there is this question that bothers all crypto beginners: Can you profit from your crypto holdings even if you don’t want to trade?

You can, but for the most part only if you are ultra-longterm bullish on crypto.

Let’s take a look at the options you have.

1/ Build a “hodl” strategy

This is the simplest method ever.

The basis of it is simply to decide whether you think a cryptocurrency is worth keeping for the long run, and hold it in your wallet.

With only a little more effort in your crypto holding strategy, you can make the actual profit taking much simpler for yourself.

Basic Hodl Strategy Step by Step


  Find a crypto with good fundamentals: network effect, resistance to bad news, a use case showing that it’s more than a vaporware.
  Once you find cryptocurrencies you want to keep, decide on how long you are willing to hold them. Ballpark is good enough: A decade? A year?
  Split that period and make a mental note on how often you will re-evaluate your investment. You can go with seasonal cycles, as long as they are relevant. Crypto traders all week all year, but there are seasonal things like the halving cycle of Bitcoin.
  Every time your point of re-evaluation comes, you can decide to rebalance and take out some amount from your profits, or to cut your losses, or to just keep holding everything.


If you are wondering about how much to invest and how to pick the best time to buy - that’s already speculation. If you are a beginner, you will do best with DCA, which is dollar cost averaging.


  Learn everything about dollar cost averaging in ATNET Strategy.


2/ Crypto Lending

If you have significant amount of Bitcoins (or Ether, or any other cryptocurrency that is traded on an exchange) you can lend it to crypto traders and other people who will pay you interest.

There is a range of lending platforms where you can do this. There are places like Ethlend where you can lend a range of some 250 ERC-20 tokens.

You can also go for margin and swap funding options for major coins via exchanges like Bitfinex or Bitmex.


  Read more on how to manage the amounts and rates for which you lend out in ATNET Strategy post on lending.


If you don’t want to manually manage the lending rates, a crypto lending bot can take care of it either for free or for a fee. The platform 3commas offers easily configurable crypto trading bots.

3/ Run a Masternode

Masternode is a cryptocurrency full node with a wallet that keeps the full copy of the blockchain. By that it supports the coin’s network.

A masternode must be always up and running and is required to perform certain tasks for the cryptocurrency network. You as the masternode owner get a payout in your node’s currency as a compensation for this.

In addition to these responsibilities, running a masternode also requires an upfront investment.

You will need to buy the node’s currency and hold it in the node wallet as a minimum to start running your node as a masternode.

4/ Staking

Staking might be the easiest way to get some extra income on some of the cryptocurrencies you hold.

It is in fact less work than holding, because it requires no strategy or evaluation - as long as you are primarily collecting more of a coin.

In order to stake a cryptocurrency, it has to follow the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. But in 2020, there are variations of “wrapped” cryptocurrencies. That means you can also stake bitcoin in its wrapped form, or even a fiat currency. The crypto trading platform Kraken is one of the places that lets you do that.

In the past you could earn up to 10% extra coins in a year by just holding and staking them. As the barrier to start staking gradually became lower, the earnings also decreased.

As of 2020, for the more mainstream cryptocurrencies you will earn better by lending them via margin funding.


  Start providing funding on Bitfinex


5/ Mining and other early opportunities: Bounties, Rebates, Cashback…

In 2020, mining of the most popular proof-of-work coins (like Bitcoin) is a lost case unless you are in special circumstances.

These days, mining is only really profitable if you are a big player, if you have cheap electricity and special equipment.

If you have mining rigs and cooling stuff left over from when small scale Bitcoin mining still paid off, you can still make some money with that on the altcoin markets.

There are new proof-of-work cryptocurrencies getting launched all the time. With new coins you can get into mining early when it’s easy and pays well.

Here on ATNET we sometimes alert you on these opportunities through our Crypto Airdrops page.

        <description><![CDATA[ Ichimoku cloud strategies for crypto: Full indicator tutorial, including the controversial topic - Does it make sense to tweak Ichimoku Cloud settings for crypto trading? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is an indicator that looks complex to traders with 5 seconds attention spans.

Once you know what it does, it makes your crypto trading decisions way faster though.

Mastering Ichimoku Cloud trading really brings you one step closer to the actually realistic goal of crypto trading:

Making high-probability decisions without spending your whole day watching your TradingView charts.

Ichimoku Cloud Definition


  Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates as “one look equilibrium chart”. It was designed specifically to enable quicker and easier decision making when it comes to the strength of a market.


Ichimoku cloud is one of the default indicators available on TradingView even with the free plan.

If you want to learn about the more advanced TradingView scripts available on free plan, we are reviewing them here: Tradingview Script Spotlight

Ichimoku Cloud Lines Explained

The Senkou and The Kumo

“Senkou span” is the name for the borders of the filled cloud, or “Kumo cloud”. The span is filled with green color in case the market is bullish. It will turn red in bearish markets, when the two spans swap.

Senkou lines are major support/resistance areas - they attract the price. Traders set their entries, exits and stops around them - usually leveraging additional information from other indicators.

The TK lines and The TK Cross

The “TK lines”, or Tenken and Kinjun, are the balance lines - fast and slow moving averages.

They are moving averages, so traders will look for their cross when they are looking for a trend reversal. Because of their names, this cross is called “TK cross”.

Nonetheless, TK lines are also important when there is no cross in sight. If the price sticks around them, it signals that the asset is neither overhyped nor underpriced. If the price action travels very far from the TK lines, it signifies the price is way out of balance and a pullback is likely, but it is by itself not a trigger to open a position for the pullback.

In more balanced markets the price stays around these lines and traders watch how it is bouncing off them or crossing them when they are looking for a good entry.

The Chinkou

The “Chinkou” span is a lagging indicator, use it to confirm a trend strength. Chinkou line above the candles means the market is strong. If the Chinkou crossed below candles, it’s a bearish turn:



When there is a strong action and the lagging line crosses the candles it is a sign the trend is weakening and becoming undecided. Reversal is likely, but again, this by itself is not yet a trigger to short:



How to read Ichimoku Cloud

BASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bullish signals

For a strong bullish signal, everything must occur above the Kumo cloud: The price action must remain above the Kumo cloud. The Chinkou line must stay above the kumo and Tenken should be crossing Kinjun also above the Kumo. Tenken should be crossing upside - if this cross occurs inside of the Kumo that’s still weakly bullish.

BASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bearish signals

If you are looking for strong bearish signal, with Ichimoku cloud you can pretty much reverse all that has been said to bullish signals - price action occurs below Kumo, as well as Tenken and Kinjun crossing and the lagging line Chinkou. Basically the more happens below the stronger the bears are.

BASICS: None of this?

If none of this is happening then it most likely means that at your timeframe the market is undecided, sideways, waiting for direction.

Market Structures suitable for Ichimoku Cloud

Ichimoku is mostly useful in trending markets.

You won’t get much information from Ichimoku Cloud in ranging markets. In market ranges, the cloud will be swapping between red and green very often, yielding very little actionable information. The same happens on short timeframes - and there are much better indicators and strategies if you want to be scalping crypto.


  To trade market ranges, it is more sensible to use the Wyckoff analysis or any oscillating indicators, possibly also with regard to divergences.


Ichimoku Cloud strategies with other TA indicators

There is a number of trading strategies that involve Ichimoku. Involve - that’s right. Even in trending cryptocurrency markets, Ichimoku Cloud is rarely used alone. Typically, traders will use it combined with other indicators.

Typically, these indicators will provide some way of identifying your support-resistance levels based on volume. It makes sense to use a volume-based indicator with Ichimoku because the cloud is only rendered from price action cycles and disregards volume completely.

Popular Crypto Trading Indicators to use with Ichimoku


  Volume, either in the standard way or as volume colored candles available from TradingView
  StochRSI or other momentum oscillators
  Fibs as an alternative way to find your most probable reversal areas
  Bollinger Bands as a way to provide some range-like bounds even if the market is trending rather than ranging


Here is a good presentation of how to use Ichimoku cloud with fractals and high-volume support and resistance levels by ChaosTrader on YouTube.

Additional Ichimoku strategies are linked at the bottom of the article.



Ichimoku Cloud Crypto Settings

Last but not least, the controversial bit:

Should you use alternative settings for Ichimoku Cloud on cryptocurrency markets?


  Ichimoku cloud uses past action of the market to predict most probable price direction in the near future.
  The cloud is rendered from simplified past moving averages calculated from past highs and lows.
  Because Ichimoku cloud takes the past action to predict the most likely future ranges and breaking points, traders want to reflect the past market action as precisely as possible.




Ichimoku works with timely moving averages, so on the crypto markets it follows reason to set meaningful timespans considering the fact that crypto trades 24/7/365.

The traditional Ichimoku cloud settings (9, 26, 52, 26):


  9 represents a week and a half of trading
  26 equals the number of trading days in a typical month (30 minus four Sundays)
  52 equals two months of trading days


The idea of special Ichimoku cloud settings for cryptocurrencies is that the market is open 24/7 (20, 30, 120, 60):


  7+3.5 = 10 (because of low volume on Sunday), or double for longer term trend capture
  30 days in a month
  2 trading months in crypto = 60 days

Some traders reject this alternative Ichimoku cloud crypto settings.

Their reasoning is that the period lengths are meant to capture a time period, it doesn’t matter whether it falls into a week or not and changing the defaults is wrong. That is different from what StockCharts article about Ichimoku says and it seems a bit ignorant to disregard movements influenced by the day of the week.

It is true that if big enough traders start to use the default settings, it will become valuable to use what they are using.

Unless you are prone to analysis-paralysis, it will not hurt to check both settings. Always backtest your indicator settings to see if it is sensible according to recent market behavior.



Ichimoku Cloud Traders and Tutorials

Below is a collection of the best that’s out there to read and watch when you’re looking to develop a Ichimoku cloud trading system for your cryptocurrency speculations.

CarpeNoctom (crypto, basic Ichimoku trading strategies)

CarpeNoctom made a basic video intro into Ichimoku Cloud that explains everything about the indicator pretty well. If you are new in trading, you should definitely watch it before you move onto the more fun but also more advanced stuff further down below.






ChaosTrader63 (Mostly legacy, but advanced Ichimoku trading strategies)

The legacy trader ChaosTrader63 has a YouTube channel and Twitter dedicated mainly to Ichimoku cloud. He mainly provides price commentary with new videos about once a week, and his trades are focused more on the long term. You will see him use the 1D chart a lot, explaining how he makes his decision. ChaosTrader63 uses the default Ichimoku settings - 9, 26, 52, 26 and is a proponent of this settings rather than of the “crypto” settings.



ChaosTrader63 is originally a forex trader so his analysis has more precision in it than what you typically get in the cryptocurrency space. He combines Ichimoku cloud with fractal trading and high-volume support and resistance levels (a simplified version of trading ranges method which can be traced back to Wyckoff).

Below his webinar on Ichimoku High Probability Trading where he explains how one can decide on an entry. If you have mastered the basics and are looking to learn some more in the way of craftsmanship, I highly recommend him.

In the video below his decision process consists of first looking at the cloud setup and waiting for a price/oscillator divergence which only establishes the direction of the potential position and a level for the entry. When that’s done one ought to look for a price signal (bounce, rejection, indecision) and finally entering the trade when a trigger appears (violation of the signal - so for instance a high volume move after a period of indecision).

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ichimoku Kinko Hyo&lt;/strong&gt; is an indicator that looks complex to traders with 5 seconds attention spans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you know what it does, it makes your crypto trading decisions way faster though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastering Ichimoku Cloud trading really brings you one step closer to the &lt;strong&gt;actually realistic goal of crypto trading&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making &lt;strong&gt;high-probability decisions&lt;/strong&gt; without spending your &lt;strong&gt;whole day watching your TradingView charts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ichimoku-cloud-definition&quot;&gt;Ichimoku Cloud Definition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates as “one look equilibrium chart”. It was designed specifically to enable quicker and easier decision making when it comes to the strength of a market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ichimoku cloud is one of the default indicators available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/atnet-tv&quot;&gt;TradingView&lt;/a&gt; even with the free plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to learn about the more advanced TradingView scripts available on free plan, we are reviewing them here: &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/tradingview-script-review/&quot;&gt;Tradingview Script Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ichimoku-cloud-lines-explained&quot;&gt;Ichimoku Cloud Lines Explained&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Senkou&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Kumo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Senkou span” is the name for the borders of the filled cloud, or “Kumo cloud”. The span is filled with green color in case the market is bullish. It will turn red in bearish markets, when the two spans swap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senkou lines are major support/resistance areas - they attract the price. Traders set their entries, exits and stops around them - usually leveraging additional information from other indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TK lines&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The TK Cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “TK lines”, or Tenken and Kinjun, are the balance lines - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.babypips.com/school/elementary/moving-averages/moving-average-crossover-trading.html&quot;&gt;fast and slow moving averages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are moving averages, so traders will look for their cross when they are looking for a trend reversal. Because of their names, this cross is called “TK cross”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, TK lines are also important when there is no cross in sight. If the price sticks around them, it signals that the asset is neither overhyped nor underpriced. If the price action travels very far from the TK lines, it signifies the price is way out of balance and a pullback is likely, but it is by itself not a trigger to open a position for the pullback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more balanced markets the price stays around these lines and traders watch how it is bouncing off them or crossing them when they are looking for a good entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chinkou&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Chinkou” span is a lagging indicator, use it to confirm a trend strength. Chinkou line above the candles means the market is strong. If the Chinkou crossed below candles, it’s a bearish turn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/v1582606126/atnet/blog_ichimoku-crypto/lagging-ltcusd_svllq1.png&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/v1582606126/atnet/blog_ichimoku-crypto/lagging-ltcusd_svllq1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is a strong action and the lagging line crosses the candles it is a sign the trend is weakening and becoming undecided. Reversal is likely, but again, this by itself is not yet a trigger to short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/v1582606127/atnet/blog_ichimoku-crypto/lagging-san_zwphbp.png&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/v1582606127/atnet/blog_ichimoku-crypto/lagging-san_zwphbp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-read-ichimoku-cloud&quot;&gt;How to read Ichimoku Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bullish signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a strong bullish signal, everything must occur above the Kumo cloud: The price action must remain &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; the Kumo cloud. The Chinkou line must stay &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; the kumo and Tenken should be crossing Kinjun also &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; the Kumo. Tenken should be crossing upside - if this cross occurs inside of the Kumo that’s still weakly bullish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bearish signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for strong bearish signal, with Ichimoku cloud you can pretty much reverse all that has been said to bullish signals - price action occurs &lt;strong&gt;below&lt;/strong&gt; Kumo, as well as Tenken and Kinjun crossing and the lagging line Chinkou. Basically the more happens below the stronger the bears are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BASICS: None of this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If none of this is happening then it most likely means that at your timeframe the market is &lt;em&gt;undecided, sideways, waiting for direction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;market-structures-suitable-for-ichimoku-cloud&quot;&gt;Market Structures suitable for Ichimoku Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ichimoku is mostly useful in &lt;strong&gt;trending markets&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t get much information from Ichimoku Cloud in ranging markets. In market ranges, the cloud will be swapping between red and green very often, yielding very little actionable information. The same happens on short timeframes - and &lt;strong&gt;there are much better indicators and strategies if you want to be &lt;a href=&quot;/strategy/scalping/&quot;&gt;scalping crypto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To trade market ranges, it is more sensible to use the &lt;a href=&quot;/strategy/wyckoff-ranging-markets/&quot;&gt;Wyckoff analysis&lt;/a&gt; or any oscillating indicators, possibly also with regard to &lt;a href=&quot;/divergences/&quot;&gt;divergences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ichimoku-cloud-strategies-with-other-ta-indicators&quot;&gt;Ichimoku Cloud strategies with other TA indicators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a number of trading strategies that involve Ichimoku. Involve - that’s right. Even in trending cryptocurrency markets, Ichimoku Cloud is rarely used alone. Typically, traders will use it combined with other indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, these indicators will provide some way of identifying your support-resistance levels based on volume. It makes sense to use a volume-based indicator with Ichimoku because the cloud is only rendered from price action cycles and disregards volume completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popular Crypto Trading Indicators to use with Ichimoku&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Volume, either in the standard way or as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/script/EHTKtnIt-ST-Volume-Flow-v6/&quot;&gt;volume colored candles&lt;/a&gt; available from TradingView&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;StochRSI or other momentum oscillators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/strategy/fibs&quot;&gt;Fibs&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative way to find your most probable reversal areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/technical-analysis/&quot;&gt;Bollinger Bands&lt;/a&gt; as a way to provide some range-like bounds even if the market is trending rather than ranging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is a good presentation of how to use Ichimoku cloud with fractals and high-volume support and resistance levels &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvCKMg8ilMI&quot;&gt;by ChaosTrader on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ichimoku-cloud-crypto-settings&quot;&gt;Ichimoku Cloud Crypto Settings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the controversial bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you use alternative settings for Ichimoku Cloud on cryptocurrency markets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ichimoku cloud uses past action of the market to predict most probable price direction in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cloud is &lt;strong&gt;rendered from simplified past moving averages&lt;/strong&gt; calculated from past highs and lows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because Ichimoku cloud takes the past action to predict the most likely future ranges and breaking points, traders want to &lt;strong&gt;reflect the past market action as precisely as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/v1582606127/atnet/blog_ichimoku-crypto/bitfinex_ichimoku_leg_cgphhq.png&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/v1582606127/atnet/blog_ichimoku-crypto/bitfinex_ichimoku_leg_cgphhq.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - &quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ichimoku works with timely moving averages, so on the crypto markets it follows reason to set meaningful timespans considering the fact that crypto trades 24/7/365.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional Ichimoku cloud settings (9, 26, 52, 26):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9 represents a week and a half of trading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;26 equals the number of trading days in a typical month (30 minus four Sundays)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;52 equals two months of trading days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of special Ichimoku cloud settings for cryptocurrencies is that the market is open 24/7 (20, 30, 120, 60):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7+3.5 = 10 (because of low volume on Sunday), or double for longer term trend capture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30 days in a month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 trading months in crypto = 60 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Parameter&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Conversion line period&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Base line period&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Lagging span 2 periods&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Displacement&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;60&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some traders reject this alternative Ichimoku cloud crypto settings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their reasoning is that the period lengths are meant to capture a time period, it doesn’t matter whether it falls into a week or not and changing the defaults is wrong. That is different from &lt;a href=&quot;http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:ichimoku_cloud&quot;&gt;what StockCharts article about Ichimoku says&lt;/a&gt; and it seems a bit ignorant to disregard movements influenced by the day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that if big enough traders start to use the default settings, it will become valuable to use what they are using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you are prone to analysis-paralysis, it will not hurt to check both settings. &lt;strong&gt;Always backtest your indicator settings to see if it is sensible according to recent market behavior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legacy trader ChaosTrader63 has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/ChaosTrader63&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChaosTrader63&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; dedicated mainly to Ichimoku cloud. He mainly provides price commentary with new videos about once a week, and his trades are focused more on the long term. You will see him use the 1D chart a lot, explaining how he makes his decision. ChaosTrader63 uses the default Ichimoku settings - 9, 26, 52, 26 and is a proponent of this settings rather than of the “crypto” settings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description><![CDATA[ Crypto mining is the true fundamental limit of all PoW cryptocurrencies. Transactions, a somewhat softer fundamental, can also provide some guidance. Learn the basics of the nature of these crypto fundamentals. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Immutability as a fundamental

Cryptocurrencies operate in a drastically different way than fiat money as we know it today. Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain, a ledger that gets generated in a sequence that cannot be reshuffled.

Blockchain shares all of its data equally between its participants. Any changes brought to the blockchain are publicly recorded, and these records cannot be tampered with. That provides it with a digital, but nonetheless real fundamental - it is impossible to generate a coin out of thin air based on the order of some authority.

The only type of cryptocurrencies where this doesn’t hold true are IOU-type coins, such as some stablecoins.

Proof Of Work

Rather than keeping all data in a single central hub, on blockchain information gets distributed in nodes called blocks. To add new information to the blocks, a member of the network would have to provide the so-called proof of work, or PoW, by solving complex mathematical problems.

One type of such “new information” are crypto transactions. In the case of PoW cryptos, that’s also how new coins are made - a process called mining.

If you want to at first learn about the very basics, and if you at the same time like straight to the point stats and numbers, just scroll down to Bitcoinfy’s infographic below.

For more advanced stuff, keep reading!

Mining as a fundamental

In PoW mining, mining devices are set up to look for a solution of a mathematical problem. When a solution is found, a new block in the ledger is found; the block is broadcast and the miner collects a reward.

An important metric called “hashrate” is the speed at which mining devices are completing this operation. Higher hashrate in the network means there is higher opportunity of finding the next block and receiving the mining reward.

There have been only a few people who studied the relationship of hashrate with a PoW cryptocoin’s price, and the amount of traders who consider this is even lower.

It makes sense, because hashrate vs price dynamic in Bitcoin or other similar cryptos it is not a quick one to react. If most crypto traders are daytrading rather than making decisions for longer horizons (say, less than ten trades a year), naturally most people in the trading community will study momentarily chart patterns instead.

There are traders who claim that “Bitcoin is structured so that hashrate follows price”. The reason is meant to be the same one as the one that contributes to the jumpy character and overreactions we keep seeing in crypto: Vague and delayed decisions.

In a bear market, a lot of miners will keep mining at a loss, hoping they will survive long enough to realize the profit once the slump is over. Traders and hodlers do a very similar thing. When it starts looking like the price is reversing, pretty much no traders are jumping in until there is some sort of confirmation. In mining, as miners drop out, the profitability of mining will start increasing to lure them back in, but just as with traders, very few are eager to make that move without confirmation. Once that comes, a whole crowd of both traders and miners return to the market.

This is why crypto mining is a fundamental aspect of PoW cryptocurrencies: It limits the movements of the market.

If it is a limit, for a trader or an investor it will make more sense to look not at the short term hashrate movements but instead at the places where the direction changes.

For that, also consider “hashprice” instead of “hashrate”. Hash Price measures the daily mining profits, it is the ratio of daily mining revenue and the hashes generated per day. Hashrate fluctuates a lot, hashprice gives a much clearer picture.



On the chart from here you can see that both hashrate and hashprice of BTC started reversing upwards when the market overreacted with the drop to 3K USD.

&lt;p&gt;An important metric called “hashrate” is the speed at which mining devices are completing this operation. Higher hashrate in the network means there is higher opportunity of finding the next block and receiving the mining reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been only a few people who studied the relationship of hashrate with a PoW cryptocoin’s price, and the amount of traders who consider this is even lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense, because hashrate vs price dynamic in Bitcoin or other similar cryptos it is not a quick one to react. If most crypto traders are daytrading rather than making decisions for longer horizons (say, less than ten trades a year), naturally most people in the trading community will study momentarily chart patterns instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are traders who claim that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/coinshares/an-honest-explanation-of-price-hashrate-bitcoin-mining-network-dynamics-f820d6218bdf&quot;&gt;Bitcoin is structured so that hashrate follows price&lt;/a&gt;”. The reason is meant to be the same one as the one that contributes to the jumpy character and overreactions we keep seeing in crypto: Vague and delayed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bear market, a lot of miners will keep mining at a loss, hoping they will survive long enough to realize the profit once the slump is over. Traders and hodlers do a very similar thing. When it starts looking like the price is reversing, pretty much no traders are jumping in until there is some sort of confirmation. In mining, as miners drop out, the profitability of mining will start increasing to lure them back in, but just as with traders, very few are eager to make that move without confirmation. Once that comes, a whole crowd of both traders and miners return to the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why crypto mining is a fundamental aspect of PoW cryptocurrencies: It limits the movements of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is a limit, for a trader or an investor it will make more sense to look not at the short term hashrate movements but instead at the places where the direction changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that, also consider “hashprice” instead of “hashrate”. Hash Price measures the daily mining profits, it is the ratio of daily mining revenue and the hashes generated per day. Hashrate fluctuates a lot, hashprice gives a much clearer picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;thumb&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-hash-price/&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/features/hash-price.png&quot; alt=&quot;Altcoin Trading Blog&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1427px&quot; data-original-height=&quot;672px&quot; width=&quot;1427px&quot; height=&quot;672px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the chart from &lt;a href=&quot;http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-hash-price/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; you can see that both hashrate and hashprice of BTC started reversing upwards when the market overreacted with the drop to 3K USD.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Shocking Facts About Cryptocurrency Heists [Infographics] ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Cryptojacking, ICO exits, scams, malware and thefts - outrageous amounts of cryptos have changed hands through illicit activity. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ If there is one question in the history of Bitcoin that cannot be answered with anything more than an estimate, it is the problem of how much of Bitcoin’s supply is actually ever available on the market. How much is locked up in wallets with lost keys, and how much is set to cool off for a few years because it was stolen?

As for the stolen crypto, the estimates are somewhat easier to make than for the cryptocoins that are “burned” and never to be moved again. According to Jameson Lopp, over 35% of Bitcoin’s supply has changed its owner in a heist - an estimate that draws from data on known cryptocurrency thefts and hacks.

With some alternative cryptocurrencies that are focused on anonymity more than the pseudonymous Bitcoin, the statistics get even more mind-blowing. According to one study, over 4% of Monero’s total supply is currently held by cybercriminals and hackers. At the price level on the day of publishing, that corresponds to over 37 million USD.

It’s no wonder that through 2018, cryptojacking became the most popular way to monetize cyber exploits. Cryptojacking, or illicit crypto mining, is done particularly easily for Monero and similar cryptocurrencies that have mining optimized for some form of ASIC-resistance. The original aim of that was to allow for wider community participation in mining by making it less profitable to use special single-purpose integrated circuits rather than your everyday ordinary laptop or phone.

The unintended but now prevailing effect is that cybercriminals can easily monetize access to any kind of infrastructure that has some spare disk space and memory - that’s practically any laptop or phone, but the juiciest plunder are the corporate ones as these usually have more available resources.

With cryptojacking, the owners or maintainers of the infected device typically have no idea there is a miner operating, and more sophisticated cryptojacking campaigns have developed various optimizations to stay under foot for as long as possible.

There are new ways of how malwares spread developed every day and the baseline of the cheap commodity malware you can buy for a couple of bucks is becoming more advanced every day.

It is safe to say that the malware industry has fully integrated the use of cryptocurrencies and is currently the most thriving cryptocurrency application.

        <title><![CDATA[ Samourai Wallet has released an update that contributes heaps to Bitcoin's fungibility ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ The 'Bitcoin wallet for the streets' deserves every bit of that marketing slogan. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ On January 21st, Samourai Wallet released an update that makes an important step towards the fungibility of Bitcoin as a payment vehicle.

When we consider the potential of cryptocurrencies to be used as money, Bitcoin has the undisputed advantage of adoption: Everyone knows what Bitcoin is, it has been used in peer-to-peer transactions for years, there are relatively easy ways to store it.

 --- article continues after advertisement --- 

By now, Bitcoin as a payment method has somewhat solidified by sticking around for so long.

One of the disadvantages though is the fact that Bitcoin’s blockchain is public. In many corners of the cryptocurrency community, this is even the main reason for Monero’s existence.

Nonetheless, there is the opposing argument as well - You only need stealth privacy quite rarely. And so, do we really need a separate crypto-money just for these rare cases? A separate blockchain for stealth transactions?

This article cannot provide an answer to that question - in time, the market will decide.

If you subscribe to the philosophy that it is not feasible to hold multiple cryptocurrencies for different uses, you will most likely benefit from what Samourai Wallet has been working on.

Staggered Ricochet

Samourai Wallet really deserves to call itself “the bitcoin wallet for the streets”. The first version of Samourai wallet came to existence during the bear market of 2015 already with the intention to offer some built-in transaction anonymizing function; ever since this angle kept only improving.

The new “Staggered Ricochet” is an extension of an existing premium option for BTC transactions called simply “Ricochet”. Ricochet is not a mixing function, but it helps to increase your plausible deniability by adding hops into your transaction - the principle is similar to relay hops used by Tor, the anonymous deep web browser.

Ricochet makes your transaction somewhat slower and somewhat more expensive, because you are inserting extra transactions between your starting address and the destination address.

Staggered Ricochet is a take on some advanced issues that are emerging as blockchain transaction analytics becomes more advanced. This update improves Ricochet by making its tell-tale patterns less recognizable: Staggered Ricochet makes sure each hop-transaction gets mined in a different block and also, each hop-transaction will only first be exposed to the mempool when it is just ready to be broadcast.

Explanation from Samourai Wallet’s blog:


  One of the clever ways of fingerprinting transactions that blockchain spies have been known to use is monitoring the mempool and using associated metadata including time first broadcast to assist in their address clustering heuristics. To help break that method Staggered Ricochet transactions will not be exposed to the public mempool until they are ready to be broadcast.


Cost and Time

On the expense side, Samourai Wallet with the Staggered Ricochet option is a good fit for  the philosophy of using stealth privacy only once in a while: As with simple Ricochet, you are paying extra fees for the hops, and additionally, a Staggered Ricochet transaction will potentially take up to a few hours to confirm because of the block restriction. You do not want to use it every time, and you don’t want to buy your coffee this way.

For the cases where you want privacy though, I would argue that state-of-the-art enhancements like the Staggered Ricochet can even be a safer option than using a private cryptocurrency: You are adding extra hops to a very busy public blockchain in a manner that cannot be easily detected.

If you choose to pay with a cryptocurrency known for its focus on anonymous transations, by doing so you are advertising that this particular transation really needs to stay hidden. All it takes is a vulnerability that breaks that ledger’s anonymity - which by all means can happen.



Samourai Wallet is available for free at samouraiwallet.com/download.

As for smartphones, the app is currently only available for Android. If you are a slightly more advanced user, you can run the Android app on your computer via VirtualBox - a how-to guide here.

        <title><![CDATA[ Michael Foster of LocalCryptos: Venezuela could be start of a bigger movement ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Chat about the business of P2P trading, challenges of crypto OTC and how a poor country can matter for the future of crypto. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Note: Interview was edited after LocalCryptos rebranded into LocalCryptos.




Just in case you didn’t figure it out, LocalCryptos is a peer-to-peer marketplace for Ethereum.

Unlike LocalBitcoins and most other OTC markets LocalCryptos is a dApp running on smart contract escrow and built-in encryption of all communication between the peers who are about to make a trade.

Also still unlike most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms, LocalCryptos is fully non-custodial. You get your own private key upon sign-up, there is no hot wallet to get hacked and no personal communication to leak. Proof of keys, proof of cash.

They are the technically most superior retail OTC platform we currently have in crypto but they are definitely not slumbering: For 2019 LocalCryptos plans to implement self-sovereign KYC as a way for traders to verify each other’s identity without trusting LocalCryptos with any personal information.

LocalCryptos did all that with no ICO, no VC money and not even what would most people call a team: Just two co-founders coding and responding to customer support tickets.

We sat down with Michael Foster, one of the dApp’s co-founders, to chat about Ethereum P2P trading in the past year, challenges of the business and his opinions on blockchain and state.








“The boom forced us to learn how to keep up, the bear market reminded us to stay frugal and remain strategic and careful.” (LocalCryptos Blog)



According to the stats from dAppRadar, daily active users on LocalCryptos have been falling through 2018 but the daily traded volumes have been steadily increasing. That means the trade has been growing, even though the number of participants has decreased.

It looks very optimistic for a year of bear market, was it the result of a targeted marketing strategy?

We definitely had to get creative with our marketing.

These days you need to think outside the box when you want to advertise in the cryptocurrency space. You’re not allowed to advertise on mainstream platforms - not only Google but also Facebook, Twitter and even Reddit.

At first, we would place our ads on niche cryptocurrency websites, but the costs of this kind of advertising skyrocketed in early 2018. There was a lot of money in the blockchain industry still from the 2017 token sale boom.

Essentially, we ended up competing for ad slots with projects that had hundreds millions of dollars in ICO money. Instead of trying to outbid them, we decided to focus on encouraging word of mouth.

That means stellar customer service?

That’s only one part of the problem. With a clunky platform you won’t create positive customer experiences no matter how excellent the customer service is.

Our strategy is to design the platform as user-friendly as possible, and on top of that we are always there to help people if they get stuck.

As a co-founder, I probably talk to thirty-plus customers each day on Telegram, sometimes late at night.

We listen and we iterate; traders who have been around since the beginning will notice the platform looks very different today compared to when we launched.

I think this proactive approach encouraged word of mouth a lot.

People often underestimate how much a small team can achieve, even without overwhelming funding. But still, you launched in October 2017 right into the peak of the cryptocurrency bubble. How did you handle the first months after launch?

There was a lot that couldn’t be predicted. The market was a roller coaster as usual, and LocalCryptos’s volume generally follows the overall market.

In the early months of 2018, we had a huge influx of signups from a mainstream audience. Our platform had only just launched then, and we weren’t ready for the overwhelming demand.

We spent hours each day brainstorming ways to simplify the user interface, and to rephrase our user guides so that laymen would understand them.

At the time, LocalCryptos was only two people.

Customer support itself became just too much to handle. At the height of the 2018 boom, I would routinely wake up to one-hundred-plus new support tickets.

Eventually we had to hire some help for our customer support desk. There weren’t enough hours in the day for us to handle customer support on top of development and everything else.

So as your user base gradually changed in 2018 along with the changes on the market, did you also notice a geographical shift?

When we launched, we had no expectations for the countries in top positions.

In terms of trade activity, Venezuela is our top country.

In terms of trading volumes, China and Russia are leading, but we have users in almost every country in the world. Other popular countries are the U.S., the U.K., Spain, New Zealand and India.

If you asked me in 2017, I wouldn’t have guessed that Venezuela would be our number one country. I might have said it would be in our top ten, but I wouldn’t have guessed it would be number one.

Many people argue the notorious interest in cryptocurrencies in Venezuela doesn’t matter. It is not a rich country after all, the amount of money a Venezuelan can bring to the cryptocurrency markets is quite small.

I don’t think the interest in crypto from Venezuela doesn’t matter. I think it could be the start of something bigger.

Seeing the growing number of LocalCryptos users from there brought me back to why I found interest in Bitcoin in 2010: Cryptocurrency has the potential to rapidly accelerate economic freedom.

Freedom is necessary for societies to progress - that’s a fact that many leaders sadly don’t understand, particularly in countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Iran and Cuba.

In my opinion, Venezuela is the most important country for developers and crypto-evangelists to focus on, and I think it could become a great example for the rest of the world once it is “flipped” to a blockchain-based economy.

That’s not an exaggeration, in my opinion the flip is totally possible.

I’m excited about cryptocurrency lifting oppressed people out of depressed economies. If I can help by providing tools people use to prosper without the state, even better.

On LocalCryptos we’ve done a lot to accommodate the demand from Latin America. The website is now available in Spanish, we opened a new Spanish telegram group, and we hired community staff in Venezuela. I’ve been learning Spanish as well, but I’m not very good.

If the flip to blockchain-based economy were to happen, peer-to-peer marketplaces would probably play an important role in it - this type of activity can initiate changes in the bottom-up direction.

Quite in general, what do you think are the biggest bottlenecks for people who are getting into P2P trading?

The biggest obstacle to P2P trading is getting your head around the whole process, especially if you’re coming from exchange trading.

One thing is your personal security and responsibility for your cryptocurrency holdings. Centralized exchanges hold your crypto for you at all times, but LocalCryptos is a non-custodial marketplace.

Second thing is trading without order books. Trading exchanges have bids and asks lined up in centralized order books and matched automatically with a matching algorithm.
On a P2P platform, users need to manually choose a person to trade with. That concept is very new and strange to some people.

Then there are also the scammers. How do you deal with abuse of the platform?

Yeah, scammers can be tricky to deal with, but I think their presence is sometimes overstated.

User reputation is a really useful tool here. At the end of each trade, users are asked to rate each other. If a user’s feedback score is very low or if they get reported, they’ll be booted from the platform.

Most types of scams can be prevented with better guides and education. Once you are aware of the scam, you know what to watch out for.

For example, the most common scam is to convince the seller to send ETH outside of escrow. The scammer will put their Ethereum address in a chat message and convince the other party to transfer ETH directly to them, before they vanish with the funds.

We’ve mostly solved this by having a loud warning message pop up whenever a user posts an Ethereum address via a chat message.

Another very common scam is for the buyer to send a fake transfer receipt and trick the seller into releasing the escrow early.

We’re now working on an improved user-interface that will clearly explain the escrow process to new users because it’s usually people brand new to cryptocurrency who are prey to scams like this. We’re also going to publish video guides later in the year.

How about more advanced abuse, like the free option scam?

You are referring to people using P2P markets as free options contracts especially during volatile times, which is a more complex maneuver.

I don’t know if it can be technically called a scam because both parties receive what they agreed upon in the end, however it can be a problem.

It does lock up the seller’s funds in the escrow, so they are potentially losing money they could otherwise use in an actual trade.

Yeah. How this works is that a buyer will lock in a trade at some rate, and then stay silent for an hour or so. If the market moves up in that period, they’ll complete the trade because they can sell the ETH immediately for a profit; if the market moves down, they’ll cancel the trade.

This kind of behaviour is tricky to detect or prevent from our side, however it can definitely be improved with better guides and education.

As a trader, you can minimize the impact of this by limiting the trade size for users you have never traded with before.

In general, if you are a P2P trader, these risks should be reflected in your pricing rather than regulated by the platform.

One last question: What is in store for LocalCryptos in 2019?

One thing you can expect in 2019 is changes to the user-interface, and even the homepage will have a makeover.

We want to make P2P trading simple for everyone, whether you are learning about Ethereum for the first time ever, or you have been trading Bitcoin since 2012.

We have some more announcements coming in the first months of 2019. Unfortunately I can’t announce some things yet; it’s too early and I don’t want to spoil a good surprise.

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Interview was edited after LocalCryptos rebranded into LocalCryptos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://localcryptos.com/r/bocmask&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;Localcryptos non-custodial p2p market&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/v1596605386/atnet/_banner/localcryptos-dark-728x90_s4yqz9.jpg&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; data-original-width=&quot;728px&quot; data-original-height=&quot;90px&quot; width=&quot;728px&quot; height=&quot;90px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case you didn’t figure it out, LocalCryptos is a &lt;strong&gt;peer-to-peer marketplace for Ethereum&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike LocalBitcoins and most other OTC markets LocalCryptos is a &lt;strong&gt;dApp running on smart contract escrow and built-in encryption&lt;/strong&gt; of all communication between the peers who are about to make a trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also still unlike most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms, LocalCryptos is &lt;strong&gt;fully non-custodial&lt;/strong&gt;. You get your own private key upon sign-up, there is no hot wallet to get hacked and no personal communication to leak. Proof of keys, proof of cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are the technically most superior retail OTC platform we currently have in crypto but they are definitely not slumbering: For 2019 LocalCryptos plans to implement &lt;strong&gt;self-sovereign KYC&lt;/strong&gt; as a way for traders to verify each other’s identity without trusting LocalCryptos with any personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LocalCryptos did all that with &lt;strong&gt;no ICO&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;no VC money&lt;/strong&gt; and not even what would most people call a team: Just &lt;strong&gt;two co-founders&lt;/strong&gt; coding and responding to customer support tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We sat down with Michael Foster, one of the dApp’s co-founders, to chat about Ethereum P2P trading in the past year, challenges of the business and his opinions on blockchain and state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;index-internal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://localcryptos.com/r/bocmask&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/atnetcloud/image/upload/v1584501676/atnet/_banner/localcryptos_banner_i0tzak.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LocalCryptos p2p trading btc eth&quot; data-original-width=&quot;3072px&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1920px&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;446px&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/LocalCryptos-office.jpg&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Michael Foster of LocalCryptos: Venezuela could be start of a bigger movement&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/LocalCryptos-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Michael Foster of LocalCryptos: Venezuela could be start of a bigger movement&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Michael Foster of LocalCryptos: Venezuela could be start of a bigger movement&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The boom forced us to learn how to keep up, the bear market reminded us to stay frugal and remain strategic and careful.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.LocalCryptos.com/reflecting-on-2018-and-building-a-colossal-2019/&quot;&gt;LocalCryptos Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to the stats from dAppRadar, daily active users on LocalCryptos have been falling through 2018 but the daily traded volumes have been steadily increasing. That means the trade has been growing, even though the number of participants has decreased.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks very optimistic for a year of bear market, was it the result of a targeted marketing strategy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We definitely had to get creative with our marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days you need to think outside the box when you want to advertise in the cryptocurrency space. You’re not allowed to advertise on mainstream platforms - not only Google but also Facebook, Twitter and even Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, we would place our ads on niche cryptocurrency websites, but the costs of this kind of advertising skyrocketed in early 2018. There was a lot of money in the blockchain industry still from the 2017 token sale boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we ended up competing for ad slots with projects that had hundreds millions of dollars in ICO money. Instead of trying to outbid them, we decided to focus on encouraging word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That means stellar customer service?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s only one part of the problem. With a clunky platform you won’t create positive customer experiences no matter how excellent the customer service is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our strategy is to design the platform as user-friendly as possible, and on top of that we are always there to help people if they get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a co-founder, I probably talk to thirty-plus customers each day on Telegram, sometimes late at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We listen and we iterate; traders who have been around since the beginning will notice the platform looks very different today compared to when we launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this proactive approach encouraged word of mouth a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People often underestimate how much a small team can achieve, even without overwhelming funding. But still, you launched in October 2017 right into the peak of the cryptocurrency bubble. How did you handle the first months after launch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot that couldn’t be predicted. The market was a roller coaster as usual, and LocalCryptos’s volume generally follows the overall market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early months of 2018, we had a huge influx of signups from a mainstream audience. Our platform had only just launched then, and we weren’t ready for the overwhelming demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent hours each day brainstorming ways to simplify the user interface, and to rephrase our user guides so that laymen would understand them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, LocalCryptos was only two people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer support itself became just too much to handle. At the height of the 2018 boom, I would routinely wake up to one-hundred-plus new support tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we had to hire some help for our customer support desk. There weren’t enough hours in the day for us to handle customer support on top of development and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So as your user base gradually changed in 2018 along with the changes on the market, did you also notice a geographical shift?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we launched, we had no expectations for the countries in top positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of trade activity, Venezuela is our top country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of trading volumes, China and Russia are leading, but we have users in almost every country in the world. Other popular countries are the U.S., the U.K., Spain, New Zealand and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you asked me in 2017, I wouldn’t have guessed that Venezuela would be our number one country. I might have said it would be in our top ten, but I wouldn’t have guessed it would be number one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many people argue the notorious interest in cryptocurrencies in Venezuela doesn’t matter. It is not a rich country after all, the amount of money a Venezuelan can bring to the cryptocurrency markets is quite small.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the interest in crypto from Venezuela doesn’t matter. I think it could be the start of something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing the growing number of LocalCryptos users from there brought me back to why I found interest in Bitcoin in 2010: Cryptocurrency has the potential to rapidly accelerate economic freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom is necessary for societies to progress - that’s a fact that many leaders sadly don’t understand, particularly in countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Iran and Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Venezuela is the most important country for developers and crypto-evangelists to focus on, and I think it could become a great example for the rest of the world once it is “flipped” to a blockchain-based economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not an exaggeration, in my opinion the flip is totally possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited about cryptocurrency lifting oppressed people out of depressed economies. If I can help by providing tools people use to prosper without the state, even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the flip to blockchain-based economy were to happen, peer-to-peer marketplaces would probably play an important role in it - this type of activity can initiate changes in the bottom-up direction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quite in general, what do you think are the biggest bottlenecks for people who are getting into P2P trading?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle to P2P trading is getting your head around the whole process, especially if you’re coming from exchange trading.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Stats from 2018 - Readers like Melancholic 100x and Ledger ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Look at one tiny piece of the economy of crypto for payments. Plus a look at search and traffic stats for hardware wallets and what it probably means. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ It is the last day of 2018 when I’m writing this post, so let me wish all the best to you and to crypto in the year 2019.

And because it’s the end of year I thought I might look at the stats of this blog for once (we’re very diligent and professional around here).

I found a couple of funny things to share with you and then one bit that you might actually factor into your support and resistance line-drawing art next year. That is, in the case crypto wanted to start moving up north again.

BitMEX, Ledger Wallet and Airdrops

Here’s the fun part of the stats that tells a lot about the readers of this blog:

1/ People are far more curious about TensorCharts than about other charting app mentioner here, but in terms of actual registrations TradingView still wins heavily.

That means we’ll have to add some more guides for TensorCharts, the learning curve is obviously an issue.


  TradingView
  TensorCharts


2/ Apparently for the readers of this blog, Trezor wallet is of absolutely zero interest other than occasionally checking back if they didn’t implement that Monero support after all.

While globally, Trezor and Ledger are contenders with nearly the same traffic. Ledger has a better affiliate program so people are more vocal about it, and it’s also cheaper than Trezor.

I personally find Trezor more user-friendly but hey ho.


  Ledger


3/ People go check out various exchanges but by far mostly sign up at BitMEX.

You guys are sick gamblers.


  BitMEX 10% fee OFF


4/ There is a good segment of readers who are only interested in airdrops and nothing else on this website.

All power to you, brothers and sisters.


  Airdrops


Where to expect the salty breakeven sellers

Now for the more substantial part.

Google Trends shows nicely the organic search interest for Ledger Nano S, Trezor and Keepkey - each the strongest keyword for each brand by the amount of traffic it brings in. The trendlines are pretty much the same for the “buy” search phrases.

The price of Bitcoin hit its current ATH of just below 20k USD on December 18, 2017. The peak search interest for hardware wallets occurred between December 10, 2017 and January 6, 2018. For Ledger especially the peak was leaning to the later dates of the range, people were “buying the dip” of the top range.

If you pull BTCUSD price data from Yahoo Finance (relevant chunk of the CSV on Keybase), daily closes for the time span give you an average buying price of around 15.5k USD per Bitcoin.

That is when majority of the retail bought in, or so it seems, and so there will probably be quite some salty breakeven sellers between 15-16k like there were around twelve hundred.

Even if a lot of the search interest didn’t lead to purchase of the wallet (or crypto), it is worth mentioning that according to SEMRush the traffic of trezor.io jumped from 4k a day to 25k visitors a day during December 2017 alone. Ledger.com gained a lot of traffic but the data is not as good because they were also slowly migrating from ledgerwallet.com to ledger.com.

What is perhaps more interesting is that both trezor.io and ledger.com maintained the new higher level of traffic through all of 2018, at least according to SEMRush. Since November apparently both sites appear to be breaking upwards but that can be a Black Friday thing.

Nonetheless, studying organic search for wallets is losing meaning just like it happened with generic bitcoin or crypto queries: People already know the products, they won’t google them anymore.

According to Alexa 80-90% of Trezor’s and Ledger’s traffic is referral or direct. People mostly come from places like MyEtherWallet, Youtube and blogs.

Doesn’t look like very dead to me, folks.

&lt;p&gt;If you pull &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history/?guccounter=1&quot;&gt;BTCUSD price data from Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.pub/altcointrading/data/BTCUSD_segment_YahooFinance.csv&quot;&gt;relevant chunk of the CSV on Keybase&lt;/a&gt;), daily closes for the time span give you an &lt;strong&gt;average buying price of around 15.5k USD per Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is when majority of the retail bought in, or so it seems, and so there will probably be quite some salty breakeven sellers between 15-16k like there were around twelve hundred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a lot of the search interest didn’t lead to purchase of the wallet (or crypto), it is worth mentioning that according to SEMRush the &lt;strong&gt;traffic of trezor.io jumped from 4k a day to 25k visitors a day during December 2017 alone&lt;/strong&gt;. Ledger.com gained a lot of traffic but the data is not as good because they were also slowly migrating from ledgerwallet.com to ledger.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is perhaps more interesting is that &lt;strong&gt;both trezor.io and ledger.com maintained the new higher level of traffic through all of 2018&lt;/strong&gt;, at least according to SEMRush. Since November apparently both sites appear to be breaking upwards but that can be a Black Friday thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, studying organic search for wallets is losing meaning just like it happened with generic bitcoin or crypto queries: People already know the products, they won’t google them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Alexa 80-90% of Trezor’s and Ledger’s traffic is referral or direct. People mostly come from places like MyEtherWallet, Youtube and blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t look like very dead to me, folks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description><![CDATA[ This is a brief report on the state of blockchain implementations in the entertainment industry. What has been done, what are the most promising concepts and where are any potential bottlenecks aside from the ingrained conservative nature of the entertainment business. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Entertainment business has long struggled with the gatekeeper problem.

So many barriers to overcome before you just barely crack the surface: Record deals, distribution rights, funding, you name it.

But even the entertainment industry is being flipped on its head with the arrival of the internet age and the democratization of content.

Through platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix, content is already being made more accessible and the road does not stop there. As the frustration over red tape continues to grow, people are looking for more ways to disrupt the industry and drive power back to where it deserves to be.

One way to do so is through blockchain technology. According to an article on CryptoDigest, the technology is already in the full swing of disrupting industries like healthcare, banking or agriculture.

It’s only a matter of time before crypto works its magic on entertainment, too. This is a brief report on the state of blockchain implementations in the entertainment industry, what has been done, what are the most promising concepts and where are any potential bottlenecks aside from the ingrained conservative nature of the entertainment business.

Blockchain to re-empower the artist

In entertainment, middlemen aren’t always a good thing. Too many parties involved will lead to hijacking of content, unbalanced income streams and loss of distribution control.

Blockchain-powered systems forge a more direct relationship between the artist and their audience. This is able to shave off critical costs and generate better returns for the artist.

One of the early innovators who tapped into blockchain for the music industry is Imogen Heap. In 2015, the Grammy-winning artist made use of the Ethereum Blockchain-based Ujo platform to distribute her song Tiny Human. This solution allowed her to price her song at just $0.60 per download — a substantial markdown from the usual pricing of $1 and up.

Blockchain for crowdfunding and fair trade relationships

The entertainment business belongs to the industries that forgot to innovate for the past few decades and its bureaucratic model is ripe for disruption.

Blockchain technology is creating more funding options, consequently more people get to earn their slice of the media pie.

SingularDTV, for example, invites fans to become investors themselves. This platform for funding of movie creation collates all forms of crypto and fiat currencies. This way it creates new liquidity in line with cryptocurrency exchanges and the 21M trading wallet.

The SingularDTV system targets everyone with a story to tell but without the means to deliver it to an audience. The innovative bit though is that it also provides an opportunity for fans to support and earn from films they actually like. This form of rewarding the fans is completely new and unprecedented.

Decentralized talent management

Because there are limited resources to scout every potential superstar out there, it is inevitable that some well-deserved talents end up fading in the background. Even for talents that are found, the struggle with funding is still real.

In sports, especially, young athletes have a difficult time covering their expenses when starting out.

TokenStars is the first to recognize this gap and to employ blockchain technology to facilitate deal-breaking support for upcoming sportsmen.

Funding for athletes opens up a wealth of possibilities and resources that can propel them to success — from better coaches and health support, to quality equipment and training.

Conducive collaboration between developers and publishers

Collaboration is the pulse of the entertainment industry, but it’s not always easy to do.

Smart Contracts can create a more streamlined approach to managing multiple teams and ensuring each member sticks to a pre-determined agreement.

In gaming, companies like Bounties Network and Qravity are connecting video game publishers to developers, tracking their contributions to new titles, and settling their wages via smart contracts.

Limitations ob blockchain tech: The price of transparency

Despite these exciting possibilities, however, blockchain technology still has its limitations.

An article focused on blockchain’s limitations by FXCM notes that while it has undoubtedly contributed to greater transparency and protection of intellectual property, it comes with the caveat of having to address the need for confidentiality.

Companies have to remember that preserving data privacy and commercial transparency doesn’t equate to integrity. At the end of the day, confidentiality terms must be agreed upon.

All in all, blockchain technology has yet to mature fully. It may take a while before it can be adopted into the vast Hollywood mainstream — a territory that is known to play it safe and stick to tradition.

But as history has proven, at the end of the day innovation is inevitable in business if one wants to stay afloat.

        <title><![CDATA[ Want to buy a house with bitcoin? ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ You very well can, no matter how much you hear on Reddit and elsewhere that nobody actually wants to use bitcoins for transactions. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ This came to us from the guys at OpenListings.com. In their blog about buying a house with bitcoin they do admit the demand rose very much through the 2017 hype.

Most of all, some new people now have money to spend, often for the first time ever in their lives. At the same time, the perspective of BTC hitting 19k USD again at some point makes it psychologically somewhat attractive to hold on to. Certainly more attractive than a lot of extra USD generated from the sale of a property, as we know USD will never hit very much at all in terms of the upside.

As the good people from Open Listings dryly put it, after 2017 there are only two things certain if you work in the real estate business:

  Your parents will ask you to explain what the hell bitcoin is over and over again.
  Your clients who’ve mined their way to crypto riches will want to know if there is a way for them to buy a house with Bitcoin.


And indeed, the real estate market doesn’t wait for blockchain political in-fights to pass nor for a sacrament of ETF approval to be granted before securing their piece of the pie.

There are still bottlenecks

Buying a house involves number of people and organizations, usually it’s not just the buyer and the seller. Even though the situation is getting better fast, there may still be bottlenecks.


  
    The seller has to be down - You can find available sellers by appending “Bitcoin” or “Ethereum” to your search. Chances are, people who will not be willing to sell for crypto unless they explicitly say so in their listing.
  
  
    The title and escrow companies have to agree to handle your transaction. It is still tricky to find insurance and escrow companies comfortable with cryptocurrency transactions. It may be the case that the escrow will require you to cash out your cryptocurrency first. You still should not be denied fiat money that was until recently in cryptocurrency, which routinely happens when putting down a payment for mortgage.
  


Come have a look

Here is a taster of what is out there to be had for your bitcoins in California and Washington, US.

These particular properties have been sold already but feel free to browse around. You will be surprised, it’s not only super posh frat boys who is being targeted.

        <title><![CDATA[ Follow the money: Who's banking on IOU stablecoins? ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Why is suddenly everyone in such a rush to create a regulated IOU stablecoin? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ While some of the marketing speak surrounding stablecoins revolves around creating a fully independent crypto ecosystem without the greedy banks, banks are the ones capitalizing here.

Adopted from the Weekly Market Commentary from TradeBlock, October 15, 2018:

Circle recently launched its own IOU stablecoin, USDC, backed by USD reserves. Circle has built out a separate entity, CENTRE, to act as a governance structure and networking entity that financial institutions opt into in order to mint new USDC stable coins. CENTRE is not the issuer of the stablecoin, the member institutions are.

According to CENTRE white paper, these member institutions are then responsible for issuing the coins and are audited by CENTRE to make sure the reserve is there.

This process works in a similar way for all IOU stablecoins: Verified customer sends a cash deposit to a member of CENTRE, the member then mints the stablecoin equivalent and sends the amount to the customer.

The issuing member now holds the cash deposit, the customer holds the stablecoin.

The issuing member is a money business or a bank: In the case of CENTRE, the only issuer (for now) is Circle. In other IOU stablecoin solutions, as well as with USDC in the future, the deposit may go to a regular bank. Circle itself is actively looking to become a federally licensed bank in the US.

But unlike with a regular customer deposit, in this case the bank is not paying interest to the depositor.

TradeBlock suggests that for USDC these banking institutions would hold the cash deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank: “As the FED raises interest rates (another rate hike is expected in 2018 and three rate hikes for 2019) these banking institutions could stand to benefit as greater interest is paid on these cash holdings.”

In other words, according to TradeBlock banks lucky enough to partner with an IOU stablecoin might stand to earn more money on customer deposits than they would if you simply held your fiat with them, because then they’d have to pay you interest.

Tether is in a vulnerable position

This fact suggests that banks would now want to compete for depositors. Decreasing trust in a vulnerable competing stablecoin solution is probably very good news everyone else in the same line of business.

The CENTRE whitepaper mentions the problems we have seen Tether have, albeit without naming any names. It simply states that they created a separate governance structure with independent stablecoin issuers to increase transparency and minimize adverse effects should issues arise (although it seems dubious to have a single, supposedly fungible token issued and backed by different independent institutions).

Tether seems to be too inter-related with Bitfinex to salvage any transparency for now: The executive members of both organizations are the same people, both companies are BVI entities, most information is tied up in non-disclosure agreements and on top of it, due to banking problems it appears that Bitfinex is now the actual issuer/de-issuer of Tether. Which is fine, if the USD reserve is there, but that is an information that is not to be publicly disclosed.

It cannot be said convincingly whether Tether is solvent or not but given the current situation it would be strange if nobody attempted to profit from this vulnerable position that Tether and Bitfinex are in.

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While some of the marketing speak surrounding stablecoins revolves around creating a fully independent crypto ecosystem without the greedy banks, banks are the ones capitalizing here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopted from the &lt;strong&gt;Weekly Market Commentary from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tradeblock.com&quot;&gt;TradeBlock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, October 15, 2018:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circle recently launched its own IOU stablecoin, USDC, backed by USD reserves. Circle has built out a separate entity, CENTRE, to act as a governance structure and networking entity that financial institutions opt into in order to mint new USDC stable coins. CENTRE is not the issuer of the stablecoin, the member institutions are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to CENTRE white paper, these member institutions are then responsible for issuing the coins and are audited by CENTRE to make sure the reserve is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process works in a similar way for all IOU stablecoins: Verified customer sends a cash deposit to a member of CENTRE, the member then mints the stablecoin equivalent and sends the amount to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issuing member now holds the cash deposit, the customer holds the stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issuing member is a money business or a bank: In the case of CENTRE, the only issuer (for now) is Circle. In other IOU stablecoin solutions, as well as with USDC in the future, the deposit may go to a regular bank. Circle itself is actively &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/circle-in-talks-with-u-s-to-become-licensed-bank-trading-venue&quot;&gt;looking to become a federally licensed bank in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unlike with a regular customer deposit, in this case &lt;strong&gt;the bank is not paying interest to the depositor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TradeBlock suggests that for USDC these banking institutions would hold the cash deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank: &lt;em&gt;“As the FED raises interest rates (another rate hike is expected in 2018 and three rate hikes for 2019) these banking institutions could stand to benefit as greater interest is paid on these cash holdings.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, according to TradeBlock banks lucky enough to partner with an IOU stablecoin might stand to earn more money on customer deposits than they would if you simply held your fiat with them, because then they’d have to pay you interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tether-is-in-a-vulnerable-position&quot;&gt;Tether is in a vulnerable position&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fact suggests that banks would now want to compete for depositors. Decreasing trust in a vulnerable competing stablecoin solution is probably very good news everyone else in the same line of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CENTRE whitepaper mentions the problems we have seen Tether have, albeit without naming any names. It simply states that they created a separate governance structure with independent stablecoin issuers to increase transparency and minimize adverse effects should issues arise (although it seems dubious to have a single, supposedly fungible token issued and backed by different independent institutions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tether seems to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1149772/the-murky-relationship-between-bitfinex-and-tether-is-raising-suspicions/&quot;&gt;too inter-related with Bitfinex&lt;/a&gt; to salvage any transparency for now: The executive members of both organizations are the same people, both companies are BVI entities, most information is tied up in non-disclosure agreements and on top of it, due to banking problems it appears that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/9ovbva/has_a_single_one_of_you_had_success_withdrawing/e7x6vgn&quot;&gt;Bitfinex is now the actual issuer/de-issuer of Tether&lt;/a&gt;. Which is fine, if the USD reserve is there, but that is an information that is not to be publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It cannot be said convincingly whether Tether is solvent or not but given the current situation it would be strange if nobody attempted to profit from this vulnerable position that Tether and Bitfinex are in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title><![CDATA[ Tokenization can boost startups in growing industries like home remodeling ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ Houzz launched its new cryptocurrency for home remodeling earlier this year. Is this a good initiative for startups like Renovaten? ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Home improvement business is projected to grow in near future, involving blockchain is just one way to increase the worth of industry.

Though cryptocurrencies already have a sizeable global footprint and faced some tough time in finding real-world value, in 2018 many businesses are just starting to tokenize their assets and services by launching their own proprietary cryptocurrencies.

Houzz, the online community for architecture and interior design, did just that in April 2018 when theyr announced their ICO.

The company launched Houzzcoinzz, cryptocurrency tokens designed exclusively for their potential users. It mimics the functionality of an in-store gift card but additionally, the token can be mined. Also, being publicly traded, the Houzzcoinzz fluctuate in monetary value and thereby in purchasing power.

Just how is it beneficial for their clients though? Is a proprietary token for home improvements a good initiative for emerging US startups like Renovaten, Next step living or Renoviso?

How does proprietary cryptocurrency benefit customers?

One of the key benefits of launching this new cryptocurrency is the simplification of transactions. Customers can buy more than 10 million products from the company, now paying instantly with a proprietary digital currency specifically developed for the home renovation and design trade.

Furthermore, the security aspect is not to be missed. The company’s blockchain protects the transaction itself as well as the shopping history of each client.

Tokenization as a breakthrough for entrepreneurs

Cryptocurrency has revolutionized the way business owners transact value, invest their savings and raise capital.

The blockchain technology offers highly impactful infrastructure for businesses to run their setups and build an entirely new business strategy in some highly trusted way without involving any centralized authority.

Even better, as nascent as the blockchain technology industry is, it offers a good opportunity to connect with the world’s famous entrepreneurs.

Businesses and individuals can transact value with the help of blockchain technology at much higher speed with very limited setup costs, and invest in high profile technology businesses in their startup phase.

The ease and cost efficiency of raising capital is a major reason; every home improvement startup should at least consider launching their own token.

Tokenization can boost startups in growing industries

According to research performed by Renovaten, the home remodeling expenses are expected to increase in the next coming years and may break the highs of ten years. The home improvement expenses in the US have already hit $304 billion this year.

Renovaten speculates new startups will continue to leverage blockchain technology to build their brands and offer the highest possible value to their customers and investors.

So, what do you think about this innovative method in the home improvement industry? Are you ready to adapt this evolution for your startup?

        <title><![CDATA[ Script Spotlight: A/D Levels ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ In this series we are picking and reviewing TradingView scripts for technical analysis that recently popped up in the daily popular feed. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ If you don’t have a TradingView account yet, make one here for free.

A/D Levels by ParCorn on TradingView



The A/D here stands for accumulation and distribution, but this particular indicator does not analyze trend at all.

It is simply looking for reversal candles on your timeframe. Once it finds a reversal candle, it draws a support line from its price level.

Full script code

The Script Breakdown

The script defines parameters for the candle - the size of the candle body and candle wick.

It then runs through the chart and finds the instances of candles with “bullish wick” and “bearish wick” which is the short-term reversal signal.

The size of the wick and candle body is relative to the true range.


  True Range of a day’s trading is the difference between the day’s high and low, extended with yesterday’s close if it lies outside today’s range.


There is also a second set of rules for 2-candle scissor reversal.

Both the 1-candle and 2-candle reversal is plotted the same way, as lines of accumulation and distribution starting from the reversal candle.

Last feature of the script is it colors the bar if the price crosses and closes over support or resistance.

Does it work?

The author himself does not comment on the use of the script but the featured timeframe on the script page is 5M. He uses the A/D Levels together with volume profile, session range and volume-weighted average price.

You will see the changed candle color better if you remove candle border color in your chart settings on TradingView.

In my charts, yellow bars indicate break through support and white bars break through resistance.

Scalping: 5M Chart

Here is the A/D Levels script on Bitfinex BTCUSD 5M as retrieved on Sep 29.



I found that it printed ridiculous amounts of supports and resistances over ranges.

At the first sight it looks confusing but once you are able to look more at the bigger picture and less at the individual lines, it does say a lot about levels of resistance and support.

You can always make the required wick ratio higher though, so that the script does not detect every little wick. The default value is 0.55 (55% of TR).

Higher Timeframes



For the 30M timeframe and made the criteria for acceptable wick ratio even higher.

It did made sense to me, even considering the repeated breaks through the support lines that quickly bounce back.

It is important to note though that the script only remembers the latest reversal candle in the time series. Above you see that in the action between 6350 and 6500 where the resistance stops dead in the air because there was another passing reversal candle found later. You will need to use some judgement when evaluating the chart.

On the 1D chart, it is quite useful when you keep the default settings (0.55, 0.25).

It does not print support on volatile days’ wicks because it compares with the true range. You can also see where support turns resistance:



Summary

A single candle does not provide enough information to really judge the market. For scalping, evaluating a candle close might often be a little late. Other than that it is easy to print candles on the short timeframe.

I would recommend it as a source of helpful information about that’s going on at the market but I would not trade it as actual support/resistance lines.

For short-term positions, TensorCharts’ heatmap and trades counter is more precise than the A/D Levels, it does not make much sense to resort primarily to candle shapes.

Nonetheless, I am surprised the indicator actually provides quite a good information once you play with it for a few minutes.

        <title><![CDATA[ The grim side of Bakkt's potential consequences ]]></title>
        <description><![CDATA[ It seems all of the critics of Bakkt point to a single issue. ]]></description>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Last month, Bakkt was still firmly in the shadow of cryptocurrency ETF proposals. Come September everything changed and the current Bitcoin community agenda regarding Bakkt seems to be one hundred percent neon pristine positive.

It is always worth being careful about new projects, particularly ones with this overwhelmingly consistent response in a space like bitcoin markets and technology.

There should be some polarization in the community, it only shows there is development potential happening from bottom up.

Without disagreements, how can the blockchain space claim it is decentralized, and how different would the community be from a scripted TV debate or personalized Facebook agenda pushing?

The thirsty traders

As it appears now, the dire market conditions messed with the appetite for decentralized governance significantly.

In August 2018, freshmen cryptocurrency investors from late 2017 and early 2018 were getting exhausted by the prolonged downtrend in the fiat value of all cryptoassets.

While there is always a lot of silent people doing their thing as the bitcoin OTC volume estimates suggest, the public community voice was clear: There was a bubble after all, the correction has been long and exhausting, we need some fundamental positive news to justify a turning point.

In other words, We need someone who actually has money to invest, unlike us at this point, to start buying. Perhaps the ETF will do that?


  Fuck the ETF, sure it can help price but why isn’t the Bakkt Project by ICE (the guys who own the fkn New York Stock Exchange) being hyped? It’s way more bullish. Physically backed futures contracts. That means they must buy the actual BTC, not like the BS futures we have now that don’t require the underlying asset to trade. ICE will have to buy up a ton of BTC and store it. Increase in price and reduced circulating supply. Win-Win. / Reddit, August 2018


This is not the place for Satoshi visions and other memes, rather it is that the community response prompts a simple appeal to common sense:


  Are you really participating in a capital market and relying with your decision making judgement on the conventional public opinions?
  With this mindset, would you have ever bought a cryptocurrency at any point in time before the bulk of 2017’s gains became publicly acknowledged?


Who criticizes Bakkt

With the majority of the community being stoked about potential relief from the bear market, there is not a lot of criticism based on ideology this time. When someone already brings up a point against Bakkt, it tends to be very factual.

And there is every opportunity to do so, for anyone who is interested: Bakkt project has a landing page and a blog but as of end September 2018, the content of both is marketing speak exclusively. Facts or responses to questions are sparse and vague.

At this stage, even an airdrop that distributes for a mailing list sign up gets questioned harder.

Not your keys, not your Bitcoin

“An ETF is a multibillion-dollar ‘not-your-keys-not-your-Bitcoin’ vehicle. That is why I am against it,” Andreas Antonopoulos said to the Bitcoin ETF obsession - an argument that applies the same to the Bakkt’s cryptoasset custody offering.

According to Antonopoulos, the implication of this big a market for “second-tier investors” is the power over consensus gained by actors who are not personally interested in the state of the network because they do not hold their own private keys.

Recalling the 2017 Bitcoin Cash fork and many other Bitcoin forks that followed, the pivotal point for most of them was the decision of major cryptocurrency exchanges to either support or disregard the forked coin. With bigger institutional investors coming to the market, should the fork pattern repeat, they will be the majority.

Nick Szabo similarly argues at this point the legacy products “might cause more problems than it’s worth”, as quoted by Bitcoinist.

The correlation of price with Bitcoin network activity

The symbiont.io president and Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long was similarly concerned about how forks will be handled by Bakkt, a question that was raised but left without an answer from Bakkt.

Long also criticized the fact that client collateral will not be held segregated for each client but in a single account (“commingled”) and that it will employ fractional reserve backing practices (“rehypothecation”).

While Bakkt futures will not offer explicit leverage, the two practices mentioned will effectively enable clients to trade with more Bitcoin than there is.

That weakens Bakkt’s contribution to price discovery and removes a degree of transparency from Bitcoin trading.

At the current state of Bitcoin markets, price action is still very much correlated with network activity and cryptocurrency exchange positions data, both of which are easily accessible in real time. Due to the hidden leverage, Bakkt trading could potentially cause events that will be divorced from metrics observable by the retail trader.

The fresh opportunity

Right now though, it appears that the business of capital management needs cryptoassets one way or another.

Elon Musk recently tweeted that he is considering taking Tesla private at 420 USD. Whether it was meant seriously or not, it has drawn the attention to a bigger problem: Due to increasingly strict regulations, the number of publicly listed companies in the US has fallen steadily since 1997.

In fact, more companies have delisted than gone public in every year of the past 20 years except the single year of 2013.

One of the implications of this situation is the damaging effect it has on portfolio management. It simply becomes more difficult to build a diversified portfolio when you don’t have a diversity of stocks to choose from, to quote the US Global Investors report written by Frank Holmes on 10th August 2018.

The report identifies cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as a potential opportunity for investors who look to diversify.

The long-enough timeline?

It seems all of the critics of Bakkt point to a single issue: While it is laudable to pioneer a crypto custody service and to set the compliance standard for others, Bakkt’s own biggest edge seems to be in creating a silo of information about a market that, given the public trading conditions in the US, may later become crucial.

Even so, there are people who believe that ultimately Bakkt’s model will fail:

“A regulated exchange with a custodian may be popular for a short period of time, but it’s not the future. The future will be the original idea of a peer-to-peer network,” says Abhishek Punia, a cryptocurrency analyst at Draper Associates, one of the VC firms that are most active in the blockchain technology industry.

After all, silos are prone to conflicts of interest and the difference from legacy finance is rampant here: Nobody is a prisoner of the only available system; unless the Earth’s electricity gets completely shut down, anyone will always have a possibility to interact with blockchains in a non-custodial or even fully decentralized manner.

If the Bakkt hype is to be taken seriously though, no flight to decentralization is likely to happen before an impactful damaging incident.

        <turbo:content><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last month, Bakkt was still firmly in the shadow of cryptocurrency ETF proposals. Come September everything changed and the current Bitcoin community agenda regarding Bakkt seems to be one hundred percent neon pristine positive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always worth being careful about new projects, particularly ones with this overwhelmingly consistent response in a space like bitcoin markets and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There should be some polarization in the community, it only shows there is development potential happening from bottom up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without disagreements, how can the blockchain space claim it is decentralized, and how different would the community be from a scripted TV debate or personalized Facebook agenda pushing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-thirsty-traders&quot;&gt;The thirsty traders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it appears now, the dire market conditions messed with the appetite for decentralized governance significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2018, freshmen cryptocurrency investors from late 2017 and early 2018 were getting exhausted by the prolonged downtrend in the fiat value of all cryptoassets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is always a lot of silent people doing their thing as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1023667334660149248&quot;&gt;bitcoin OTC volume estimates suggest&lt;/a&gt;, the public community voice was clear: There was a bubble after all, the correction has been long and exhausting, we need some fundamental positive news to justify a turning point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;We need someone who actually has money to invest, unlike us at this point, to start buying. Perhaps the ETF will do that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description><![CDATA[ In this series we are picking scripts for technical analysis that recently popped up in the TradingView daily popular feed. ]]></description>

PPO Divergence Alerts (PPOD)

Full script

PPOD is a script that plots labels under or above candles where a divergence on PPO occurred.

PPO or Price Oscillator is a technical indicator very similar to MACD. It is calculated the same way as MACD but it presents the final value as a percentage.


  
    MACD takes the difference in values between those two Moving Averages and an EMA of those Moving Averages, then plots that difference between the two lines as a histogram.
  
  
    PPO does the same but it then calculates a percentage. This makes value comparisons simpler over longer durations of time.
  


The PPOD script is this PPO Divergence script only re-styled so that it will plot labels instead of a line indicator below the chart. It can be rewritten for use with other oscillators.

Parameters: (lookback period to look for divergences, PPO fast line, PPO slow line, PPO signal line, PPO smoothing)

Does it work?



This is the PPOD indicator on 1D chart of BTCUSD on Bitfinex using the default settings: (55,12,26,9,2).

Here the strongest signals are the red and pink labels that signify a bearish and bullish divergence on that timeframe. The red and green arrows show where the PPO was overbought and oversold - it is an oscillator which means you can use similar patterns as you would with MACD or RSI.

We can see on 1D the PPOD caught the 20k top although only after two other bearish div alerts at range tops. It also registers the current bottom.



On 4H you can see it registers the recent 8400 top couple of candles after the fact, but then it prints another divergence on the bounce which ended up being a pivotal point. That’s not bad.

If you are a scalper, you will run into problems on short timeframes and on the 1W chart the overbought/oversold fits better than the actual divergences:



In both cases it is important to remember what divergences actually show: If a divergence happens, there is a mismatch between the price and the buy or sell momentum. That strengthens the potential for a reversal but it is not itself a trigger to trade on that reversal. Whether you find a divergence or not does depend a lot on your settings, and I don’t think the same settings will necessarily be suitable for all market conditions.

Now specifically to shorter timeframes - If the volatility is high, there will always be divergences. They show the price is overshooting, nothing else. The only actionable information to take from that is “maybe I should become a market maker”, I think. It means nothing for trades that are meant to last longer than a couple of minutes.

Divergences are not useless for scalpers and daytraders though. One good strategy is to start the day looking at 4H to see what will most likely be the dominant direction of the session. Some days it is better to primarily focus on quick longs, some days on quick shorts.

In the most basic way you could simply plot an MA to see whether the price is above or below it. Divergences can be used in a similar way for confirmation.

Removing the Lines Is NOT An Advantage

There is one problem I have with line indicators reduced to simple alerts though: You do not get to see whether your indicator settings are not complete rubbish.

Say, you are a scalper and want to use PPO Divergence alerts on 5M chart. You will load the chart, find that the default settings don’t fit and you will start tweaking them.

Maybe you will find that settings with very low smoothing and big difference between the fast and slow lines work best, and you decide to go with that. The alert script keeps printing the alerts just the same but you don’t know there is more noise than signal unless you plot the actual underlying line indicator with your settings.

Plotting a single symbol works much better with events that do not have development. You can do it nicely with “rektlines”: Find singular events that will trigger most of the bots - something like an MA cross, an Ichimoku TK cross, MACD cross. Calculate 10% and 5% level against the position of the bot and you have a level where the bot positions on 10x and 20x leverage will get liquidated.

In this kind of case plotting a single symbol is completely fine but I would not use PPO Divergence alerts only without also using the line indicator.

Better Alternative: The Adaptive RSI Divergences

Full script



I can recommend using scripts that will paint the divergence along with the underlying indicator, though. Looking for divergences is a pain.

You can use the PPOD but I prefer this Adaptive Divergences script which plots the actual div lines.

Also, this particular script is an implementation of John Ehlers’ Adaptive RSI. The length value is not specified by user, it adopts according to the price development. The script looks for price cycles and bases the length values on them which gives less false signals. Do try this one.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/script/SvPOv1cc/&quot;&gt;Full script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/scriptspotlight/divergences/adaptive-rsi.png&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Script Spotlight: Automatic Divergences&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;border&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.altcointrading.net/features/scriptspotlight/divergences/adaptive-rsi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Script Spotlight: Automatic Divergences&quot; title=&quot;AltcoinTrading.NET - Script Spotlight: Automatic Divergences&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; width=&quot;700px&quot; height=&quot;360px&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can recommend using scripts that will paint the divergence along with the underlying indicator, though. Looking for divergences is a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the PPOD but I prefer this Adaptive Divergences script which plots the actual div lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this particular script is an implementation of John Ehlers’ Adaptive RSI. The length value is not specified by user, it adopts according to the price development. The script looks for price cycles and bases the length values on them which gives less false signals. Do try this one.&lt;/p&gt;
