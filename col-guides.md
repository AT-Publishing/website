> Blockchain Technology 101: Blockchains, Blocks and the Role of Price

#### Definition of Blockchain

Blockchain is a term that denotes literally a chain of blocks, where block is a bundle of confirmed transactions and additional features that ensure blocks cannot be skipped or reordered in the future.

#### Definition of Block Time

**Block Time** can be defined as the average time that is taken for generating an extra block in the block chain.

Bitcoin Block Time: For Bitcoin 10 minutes will be the block time.

#### Definition of Private, Public and Consortium Blockchain

[Blockchains](https://bitcoinfy.net/bitcoin-and-blockchain-technology/) are functioning under the peer to peer networking method. As it is a straightforward phenomena: Not involving any third person into the transaction process.

**Private blockchains** are similar to decentralized databases and may have its use as an internal tool for organizations and businesses where member parties do not want to trust each other.

Bitcoin is a **public blockchain**, meaning the use of it is not restricted to anybody. The transactions on Bitcoin blockchain cannot be deemed as canceled nor taken back. This is known as “Reversibility of Transactions”. This is to be noted that majority of the users have lost their Bitcoins, just because of their sheer negligence while transacting.

A **semi decentralized blockchain** is known as the **“Consortium Blockchain”**. The users will be restricted by the administrators of this blockchain, since only the faithful nodes are enabled for executing the consensus protocol.  

Now, how can a Bitcoin be owned?

#### Bitcoin Regulatory Hurdles

Bitcoin specifically has also faced many regulatory issues from protective governments. There are some countries such as Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia, and Kyrgyzstan that have declared Bitcoin as illicit and illegal.

#### Availability & Price of Bitcoin

* “Bitpay” or Coinbase” are the usual Bitcoin payment services for merchants who decide to accept cryptocurrencies. One of the other popular processors in the past was also “Mycelium“.
