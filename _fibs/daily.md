dollars:

- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "The break of the MA (bbands center) was quickly overturned with a convincing double bottom bounce, currently ETHUSD has already broken up through the fib at $783." }
- { market: "XRPUSD", chart: "/fibs/xrpusd.png", comment: "XRP is actually consolidating and not dropping like crazy: that's a good thing. Not a buy though, other than for a scalp." }
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Bitcoin fans are surely happy the coin is at 13.5 at the moment but it is looking as heavy as yesterday." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "Currently attacking the marked peak. Let's see. If broken, next stop is at 0.07 BTC." }
- { market: "EOSBTC", chart: "/fibs/eosbtc.png", comment: "EOS is one of the finex coins that is surging at the moment - against USD and BTC but not against ETH - and also one that is trusted for being potentially more than a fad. Pricewise I'd just like to point out the resistance in the BTC ratio where it's at right now is significant. Not a place to FOMO (even though someone has to if it's to blast through)." }

This is a new section on AltcoinTrading that will have only USD and BTC charts from Bitfinex for selected cryptocurrencies with Fib retracements drawn on them and some brief commentary. It's going to be updated often but it will stay under this current link so you can bookmark it to check for updates. The latest update date will always be in the headline.
