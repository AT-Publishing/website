- { market: "NEOUSD", chart: "/fibs/neousd.png", comment: "Bullish, now let's see if this current surge get's stopped by the fib or if it goes above and gets stopped by the bband. If it reverser at the fib it would make lower high relatively to the bbands which would be a weakness." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "ETH is hanging in the middle of nowhere on the 1D but the bbands on 3H are tight, there will be some action soon - probably a bullish one." }
- { market: "XRPUSD", chart: "/fibs/xrpusd.png", comment: "Consolidation. As with ETH - the bbands are tight and the bias is positive." }
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Not a good place to FOMO, bitcoin is still not past the resistances from the previous runup to 20k." }
- { market: "IOTUSD", chart: "/fibs/iotusd.png", comment: "Another day of pretty much no action." }

ratios:
- { market: "EOSBTC", chart: "/fibs/eosbtc.png", comment: "If you're watching the EOSBTC resistance area, the daily bbands are tightening as well. The markets are collectively in preparation for action." }
