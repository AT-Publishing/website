- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "On the way to next fib resistance at $1091. Wouldn't be surprised by some chop, maybe throwback to previous ATH." }
- { market: "XRPUSD", chart: "/fibs/xrpusd.png", comment: "The fidget spinner coin did the same style of top wick from below the fib resistance as the last time. Drawing a new fib retracement from the previous ATH, the downside target for this retracement is about $2.42. Retracing there or slightly above would also be a throwback to previous ATH, which would mean it will keep going for now." }
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Another day, another failed pushed above resistance. The daily closed green though (even though the pump right before the close takes away some of the credibility of the candle), and the MA on 1D seems to be very slightly curving up. " }
- { market: "IOTUSD", chart: "/fibs/iotusd.png", comment: "Still positively curving up, don't get shaken out." }
ratios:
- { market: "EOSBTC", chart: "/fibs/eosbtc.png", comment: "Still fighting that resistance line." }
