- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "The decision wasn't reached yet on ETHUSD - looking fairly neutral. Either it will bounce around 1k or there will be a reversal and possible deeper correction to around 700 USD." }
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "It looked quite bullish lately with BTC, with the symmetric triangle broken upwards and then doing what seemed to be a throwback to the triangle. The bears are stronger on BTCUSD today, though. With the drop today, the high-vol support box is in play again." }
ratios:
