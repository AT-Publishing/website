dollars:
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Judging by the fact that on the SK FUD the price didn't drop wildly, the market seems to be gaining confidence. The bands are tightening and pointing horizontaly now, not down. Sitting on 2 fib support levels, this could actually bounce." }
- { market: "IOTUSD", chart: "/fibs/iotusd.png", comment: "IOTA paints a similar situation as BTCUSD." }
- { market: "XRPUSD", chart: "/fibs/xrpusd.png", comment: "Riding on the Moneygram partnership news. Technically, not considering wicks, the 1.7 USD fib level was somewhat respected after all and the candle close bounce from the 1D MA is bullish." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "During the full on market crash, ETHUSD didn't drop past testing the previous ATH wicks. The bias is bullish but the market could also consolidate and form a range here before attacking 1400 USD again." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "The surge to .1 BTC was indeed stopped by the bband. On the next push, there will be some resistance on the candle closes at .089 but the action depends on both ETHUSD and BTCUSD actions now." }
