dollars:
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "Everybody is watching that inverted head and shoulders that could be a possible bottom but the truth is if the horizontal range on the ETH top is a distribution, a recovery now should reverse at around 1k USD and head back down." }
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "There are bullish divergences on shorter timeframes but hidden bearish divergence on a 1D chart with RSI. The situation is similar to ETH, at this point in crypto markets there is still the situation where cryptocurrencies move rather together (as stocks)." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "Nothing changed here this week, not even with that massive sell volume. Bbands are still tightening." }
