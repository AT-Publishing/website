dollars:
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.jpg", comment: "The bullish action at $BTCUSD looks like possibly a second attempt to break to high-volume resistance around 11.5k USD (on the chart coinciding with the blue rectangle drawn from previous fibs). If this is successful, a lot of traders will scream iH&S which, if played out, would have a target somewhere over 16k USD. If you follow datamish.com you probably notices how in the recent days rapid increases in shorts didn't move the market much anymore, therefore there must be some demand already." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.jpg", comment: "On the Bitfinex chart, $ETHUSD is just breaking out of the downtrend (yellow dotted trendline). There is some resistance upcoming - a current fib coincides with kumo top and and a previous support-turned-resistance (yellow dotted horizontal line). This area around 990 USD is a key one for now. " }

ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.jpg", comment: "For now, the short term, ETH is more in the consolidation phase than BTC which is attempting a surge at the moment. The ratio will therefore not be very bullish. It bounced down off a fib but overall the short play seems to be almost over too. There is still a lot of longs in $ETHBTC although a massive amount closed couple days ago (on Bitfinex)." }
