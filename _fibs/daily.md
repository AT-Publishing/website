dollars:
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Bitcoin is currently sitting around the area of several fibs that coincide and make for a strongish resistance. The formation is a potential W bottom, relatively to bbands there was a lower high already but the news from Korea can shake things up." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "Similar formation as Bitcoin's but bbands are tighter which should make for a more explosive move (either way). Bbands are curling down. ETH is popular in South Korea so again, the bad news will have effect here." }
- { market: "XMRUSD", chart: "/fibs/xmrusd.png"}
- { market: "XRPUSD", chart: "/fibs/xrpusd.png", comment: "Ripple is one cryptocurrency that is not painting pretty much the same W chart. There is an ATH resistance at the moment though. " }
- { market: "OMGUSD", chart: "/fibs/omgusd.png", comment: "OmiseGo looks the droopiest of the pack with the new low. Bbands are tight and curling down." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "If the ETH ratio has seen the bottom this would be in for a nice long entry. There's no breakout yet though." }
- { market: "LTCBTC", chart: "/fibs/ltcbtc.png", comment: "Huge range. Break of ATH would be bullish." }

It's going to be updated often but it will stay under this current link so you can bookmark it to check for updates. The latest update date will always be in the headline.
