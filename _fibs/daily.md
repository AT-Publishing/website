dollars:
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "I think we can call it a failed bounce, all resistances get sold off. BTCUSD keeps hovering in the lower parts of the range." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "ETH went as low as 1255-ish and bounced but no new highs. Consolidation is not over." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "The ratio keeps testing the .618 fib and eventually that resistance will probably be broken, but it might take a while." }
