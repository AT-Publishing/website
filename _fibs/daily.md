dollars:
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.jpg", comment: "Bitcoin bounced off its high-volume support from a previous meaningful range (blue dotted line) for now. The next resistance is a fib line coinciding with some short term sideways history area around 8700. Scaling down to shorter timeframe reveals oscillators jumped up to the overbought territory way too fast to take down that resistance and continue up." }
- { market: "SANUSD", chart: "/fibs/sanusd.jpg", comment: "Santiment is (not surprisingly) moving similarly to bitcoin, however, but the volume indicator PVT here is leaning a bit more bullish. It is way too soon to make any conclusions out of that though." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.jpg", comment: "Ethereum dropped out of all ranges, still a way to go to a high volume support around 415 though (blue dotted line)." }

ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.jpg", comment: "In the ratio, ETHBTC already sits at a high volume support. This one was hard to break up, if it breaks down now things might get ugly." }
