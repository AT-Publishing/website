dollars:

- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "Broke out and trading above $900. Next fib stop is at $1091." }
- { market: "XRPUSD", chart: "/fibs/xrpusd.png", comment: "Ripple broke up above the next fib resistance. It should now consolidate a bit." }
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Bitcoin dumped on the news about China a bit, and has just about recovered. The market is not at its strongest and currently sitting under plenty of resistance (and under the MA in the center of the bbands on 1D)." }
- { market: "IOTUSD", chart: "/fibs/iotusd.png", comment: "IOTA is still waking up, so far holding the positive trend. The moving average (bbands middle band) is curving up on the daily which is bullish, the consolidation phase should be soon over. It is also the place where some bots detect the curving and start going long before everybody else does on a confirmation so this is an ideal place for some FOMO pump and then some stop-hunt." }
- { market: "NEOUSD", chart: "/fibs/neousd.png", comment: "Someone commented I should add NEO, here it is. So, NEO has broken ATH resistance and retraced to confirm it - very bullish. The next fib is roughly at $116 however the market surged too fast. These coins will have this 'joint action' together with ETH and perhaps EOS for some time, maybe for the all of 2018 - the action is based on similarity of attributes of those coins: The value propositions are similar but there are no clear signs as to which one is the actual leader. Technically, it is usually a good place for a bit of sideways when the daily comes over the outer bband (stdev 3)." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "Making new highs, trend is positive. Next stops for some consolidation are (roughly) 0.07, 0.08 and 0.09." }
- { market: "EOSBTC", chart: "/fibs/eosbtc.png", comment: "Update on EOS - the trend of the BTC ratio is still positive but still not out of the woods: that resistance hasn't been broken." }
