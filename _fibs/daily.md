dollars:
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "The downside goal of 700 USD level is being reached. It lies on a high volume range that should act as a support, but if it doesn't, the next meaningful range is at about 450 USD. ETH was trading in a horizontal range for a long time - until today Feb 5 really, which shows some strength but for now there is need for a reversal anyway." }
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "The support in high 7xxx USD appears to be failing, and this is not a quick panic sell-off to scare people. This is failing rallies and slow bleed. If 7k is broken, the next range lies around 4.5K but honestly at this point the time is to look for a long entry already. " }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "Wrecked on the shorter timeframes but preparing for a big move on the 1D, judging from the bbands." }
