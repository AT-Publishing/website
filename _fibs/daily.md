dollars:
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Bitcoin has failed to carry on with the bounce at the top of the resistance area around 17k. The retracement should find support somewhere between 14.2k and 15k - otherwise there will be blood on the streets." }
- { market: "IOTUSD", chart: "/fibs/iotusd.png", comment: "Sadly, IOTA is following BTC but with less intensity." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "Ether is the leader today: broke above the 1090 fib and retraced back as a throwback. Bullish." }

ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "On the ratio market ETH is still in the resistance area. If bitcoin continues further down today, the ETH ratio will probably break upwards." }
