dollars:
- { market: "XRPUSD", chart: "/fibs/xrpusd.png", comment: "Ripple broke the ATH resistance nicely and currently sitting at the next fib resistance. It really should retrace a bit if this run is to be sustainable. A bull flag up here would be nice as well." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "Still not making new highs but the short term downtrend line was broken. Bbands on 6H and 12H are looking more optimistic, on 1D the positive trend clearly hasn't been broken." }
- { market: "EDOUSD", chart: "/fibs/edousd.png", comment: "Looking strong over the past days - Eidoo got the same kind of correction as BTC and many alts but swiftly made new highs. Currently sitting at ATH resistance. I am testing the Eidoo wallet for Android, there will be a post."}
- { market: "IOTUSD", chart: "/fibs/iotusd.png", comment: "Compared to for instance the ETHUSD 1D chart, IOTA is looking weaker at the moment. According to this strawpol the majority of the crowd has been bullish on it for 2018: https://strawpoll.de/3e111xx - What we see now is a consolidation after a big move though. Not a good convincing place to pick sides for the short term." }
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Bitcoin is also consolidating and also weaker than ETHUSD. Currently sitting under an area of major resistance." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "In the ratio, ETH is attempting a breakout again. Now would be a good time to do it when BTC is just consolidating." }
- { market: "EOSBTC", chart: "/fibs/eosbtc.png", comment: "Here's a madway chart without fibs. It's the BTC ratio of EOS, but: an unbroken positive trend and again, a good time to paint something resembing a cup and handle. Volume is miniscule at the moment." }
