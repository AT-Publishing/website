dollars:
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "After a weekend of shakeouts the dip continues. For now it is still in the old Fib range (it bounced down off a fib resistance) but it's reasonable to expect the price will go lower. The closest meaningful support is the last big range around 7k USD (blue rectangle)." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "ETH is painting a similar structure as BTC even though the ETHUSD market is stronger. It is currently around the MA (center of bbands) but, as with BTCUSD, the meaningful support is the last range (blue rectangle)." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "Because ETH is stronger than BTC at the moment the ratio of ETHBTC is still bullish-looking. I've drawn the analogous blue rectangle - in case of the ratio it was resistance, now turned support." }
