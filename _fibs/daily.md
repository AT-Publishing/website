- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "The bounce from the MA on the daily and wick to the .382 fib look convincing. It needs some time, bbands are still not pointing anywhere on the 1D (on 12H they go up) but this could be the end of the correction." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "As yesterday, ETH is the place to be today. The surge is too steep though, even if the next fib is around 1460 the trend could bounce down from the bband if it keeps going this fast." }
- { market: "NEOUSD", chart: "/fibs/neousd.png", comment: "The daily candle on NEOUSD stopped pretty much on the fib around $124. Looking at the bbands it could carry on to around $140 but it would need more volume. If there's a local top here it would be a lower high relatively to the bbands and a sign to get out. " }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "Yesterday's action was a convincing break up through the resistance. Next potential stop is at .087, after that .1 BTC." }
