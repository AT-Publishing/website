dollars:

- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "The surge on ETHUSD was too fast and got stopped by the bband. There could be one more push upwards but a retest of breakout wouldn't be surprising either." }
- { market: "XRPUSD", chart: "/fibs/xrpusd.png", comment: "XRP hit the target of the correction - dropped to about $2.20, bounced with a proper bottom wick and currently sits at previous ATH. It should consolidate here for a bit, if it starts dropping more this might be it." }
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Bitcoin finally broke upwards. There is no fib here in the area around 17k but if you look closela at 4H candles from the runup to 20k you will see there is still plenty of resistance right where it's at now. It is still a risky situation especially for medium-term leveraged positions: even after the 17.9k fib the market could still decide to make a range on 1W and drop again." }
- { market: "IOTUSD", chart: "/fibs/iotusd.png", comment: "Same as yesterday: Still positively curving up." }
- { market: "NEOUSD", chart: "/fibs/neousd.png", comment: "NEO bounced from a weak-ish support at $88 during its retracement. Let's see if this was the bottom of the bull flag." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "With ETHUSD consolidating the ratio really took the hit but in fact at the moment it looks merely as throwback to resistance. " }
