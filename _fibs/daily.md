dollars:
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "BTC is sitting below a resistance right now. The markets look like there will be a chop for a few weeks now, perhaps even until March if the cycles determined by quarterly contracts are still happening, so there might be some action to catch the too-eager breakout traders. There is not going to be a definitive direction for some time now, be patient." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "ETH is painting similar structure as bitcoin in the USD pair, however the whole drop was not as bloody as bitcoin's: ETH didn't drop to the lower bband on higher timeframes. On the USD pair there is a resistance now, as with bitcoin, but it has implications for the ratio." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "Again, the ETHBTC ratio is the one market that is closest to bullish right now." }
