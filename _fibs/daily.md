dollars:

- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "ETH is still fighting the ATH resistance but you know that bull run usually doesn't stop there when a coin is bullish." }
- { market: "XRPUSD", chart: "/fibs/xrpusd.png", comment: "XRP is going for it agai although it is moving along the stdev 2 bband which means the bull is weaker. Looking at shorter timeframes though, there will be a place to call tops but it's likely too soon just yet. There has been a rumor that Coinbase is going to list it, with how much it surged it will be interesting to see if they'll want to deal with another insider trading allegations." }
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Bitcoin started showing some bull momentum today, broke up through a first line of resistance and is hanging there at the moment. Next big decision will be whether it will break above the .618 fib (around 16.4k). By the way, watching Bitfinex orderbook has been fun today. Someone was really going for it." }
- { market: "IOTUSD", chart: "/fibs/iotusd.png", comment: "IOTA is waking up, let's see how it holds." }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "The ratio retraced when BTC started surging couple hours ago but it didn't go below that fib it just broke, it merely retested it and bounced. That's positive." }

This is a new section on AltcoinTrading that will have only USD and BTC charts from Bitfinex for selected cryptocurrencies with Fib retracements drawn on them and some brief commentary. It's going to be updated often but it will stay under this current link so you can bookmark it to check for updates. The latest update date will always be in the headline.
