- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "The positive trend line defined by moving average (bband center) was broken on 1D - daily of 30 Dec closed below. ETH is still holding the level for now but there is some downward pressure (sell volumes)." }
- { market: "IOTUSD", chart: "/fibs/iotusd.png", comment: "Iota is keeping in the slight downtrend (consolidation), not much going on. The ratio (IOTBTC) is up thanks to bitcoin's action." }

It's going to be updated often but it will stay under this current link so you can bookmark it to check for updates. The latest update date will always be in the headline.

* It's [from zerohedge so grain of salt and all that](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-29/stunning-look-inside-world-south-koreas-bitcoin-zombies), but it's an interesting article about how the crypto madness looks in South Korea: Everybody wants to be a crypto investors, young folks are making tons of money, students have "clubs" where they trade together (and make decisions together as opposed to the western world that engages in fights between subreddits). It's not difficult to see why these new traders lead the market and how it looks like.
