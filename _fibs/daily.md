dollars:
- { market: "BTCUSD", chart: "/fibs/btcusd.png", comment: "Bitcoin broke down below the MA and keeps dumping. If there's not a bounce between 12.7k and 12.9k, 10k will be a real possibility." }
- { market: "XRPUSD", chart: "/fibs/xrpusd.png", comment: "So the 3-something USD was the top for real. The 1.7 USD level doesn't look like holding, next potential bounce level would be at around 1.25 USD. Looks like this time the pumpcoin profits didn't flow to BTC though." }
- { market: "ETHUSD", chart: "/fibs/ethusd.png", comment: "Despite all the bullish fundamentals ETH actually joined the blood on the streets today: what looked like a bull flag below a fib resistance broke down to previous breakout level around 1240 USD. There has been a good bounce though, and if the daily closes green the bias remains positive." }
- { market: "IOTUSD", chart: "/fibs/iotusd.png", comment: "Consolidation broke down, although not too dramatically. " }
ratios:
- { market: "ETHBTC", chart: "/fibs/ethbtc.png", comment: "Look at the bands! Rise to .1 BTC in one day yesterday was too much too fast. Even a dip to 0.08 and some consolidation would not be a place to panic." }

Two of the paper’s authors were funded by Bitfury while a third was funded by the Russian Science Foundation." ... "Crude ways around it are obfuscation methods whereby one makes a number of transactions for the sole purpose of de-linking the original identity to a specific address. In bitcoin, however, that is now very expensive, if at all possible, due to a very limited 1MB of data, which Bitfury campaigned to maintain perhaps in aid of their surveillance work." ... "Which spurred work on privacy for ethereum, while for bitcoin there hasn’t really been much movement with the project feeling stale at the protocol level."
