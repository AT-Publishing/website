This is our section for upcoming cryptocurrency airdrops, published in sections month by month with all the data you need to participate. We do our best to hand-pick and verify all the information about airdrops and forks that we get. When something looks slightly fishy, we won't publish it. However, you should still be careful when claiming coins. The information published here comes without any guarantees from us, you are responsible for your own security.
