##### TradingView PRO Pre-BlackFriday 2019: Pay in Bitcoin Promo Deal

{{ site.stars.three }}

TradingView has an offer for crypto traders to promote their new payment option - Bitcoin. Previously, you were only able to pay your TradingView PRO with Paypal but since February 2019, a BTC payment option is added.

The price for the **unlimited TradingView** subscription with bitcoin payments is **fixed at 0.09 BTC per year**, and so the USD price for your TradingView PRO varies with the changes in BTCUSD price.
