**ATNET anticipates 70+% Off on 3-year Plan at AirVPN Black Friday 2020.**

AirVPN is a privacy-minded VPN provider that accepts Bitcoin payments (directly, without any intermediaries), DASH, LTC, Monero, PayPal and other means of payment.

For the Black Friday 2019, they offered up to 74% discount on AirVPN plans. The discount grew with the length of the plan.

The 2020 Black Friday deal structure is expected to be similar.

**AirVPN Black Friday price: Breakdown per month with anticipated Black Friday discount**

* AirVPN **3 year subscription** plan with the Black Friday deal: `99 EUR -> 64.35 EUR` (**1 year free** compared to yearly pricing, or monthly Airvpn cost of **1.79 EUR**)
* AirVPN **2 year subscription** plan with the Black Friday deal: `79 EUR -> 51.35 EUR`
* AirVPN **2 year subscription** plan with the Black Friday deal: `49 EUR -> 31.85 EUR`

For long subscriptions, it definitely pays off to wait for the next AirVPN Black Friday offer.
