TradingView subscriptions can now be paid via PayPal, credit cards, debit cards _or via cryptocurrency_. When the crypto payments were launched, there was an offer called "Tradingview To The Moon".

It set the subscription price as denominated in BTC, and because BTC was trending sideways or down then, you could get as much as 50% off as the fiat value of BTC dropped.

This was a rare opportunity to get some money off on TradingView though. You're pretty much stuck with Black Friday.

<em>Start with <a href="http://bit.ly/at-tvd-eth" rel="nofollow">TradingView FREE plan</a> and if you like it, upgrade on Black Friday.</em>
