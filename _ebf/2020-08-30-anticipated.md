Here are the **anticipated crypto deals** for BlackFriday 2020.

In the rest of this bloody long post on AltcoinTrading.NET you can also learn of what kind of offers we got last year during **Black Friday 2018/2019** and the previous years. Successful campaigns are most likely to repeat (or rhyme) in November 2020.

#### Ledger Nano X Black Friday 2020: Anticipated Site-Wide Discount

Every year, Ledger wallet Black Friday deals come in a sequence.

Whereas during the year, crypto hodlers can get a good deal with bundles, on Black Friday Ledger typically does site-wide discounts.

In 2019 the first wave of pre-BlackFriday sale came with 30% off site-wide at Ledger. It was not as low as it could get, but there was enough stock and the discount applied even on Ledger Nano X which was still a new product.

##### Ledger Nano X Black Friday 2020: Anticipated 30% Off

The Ledger Nano X is a BluetoothÂ® enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.

Nano X is still the top product that Ledger has, so we do not expect much hotter deals than 30% off.

#### Ledger Nano S Black Friday 2020: Anticipated 70% Off

Ledger Wallet did the Black Friday 2017 offer of 21% off on your Ledger Ledger Nano S, but in Black Friday 2018, the disount on Nano S went up to 50% discount.

In 2019, Nano S buyers could get it with as much as 60% off, albeit for a short time in a bundle deal.

The pattern is clear however that as the product gets older, the discount in sales events grows. We are anticipating the 2020 Black Friday deal on Ledger Nano S to be around 70% off.

Year on year, the Black Friday offers have been getting a tad better as the competition keeps popping up for TradingView.

#### AirVPN Black Friday 2020: Anticipated 70+% Off on 3-year Plan

AirVPN is a privacy-minded VPN provider that accepts Bitcoin payments (directly, without any intermediaries), DASH, LTC, Monero, PayPal and other means of payment.

For the Black Friday 2019, they offered up to 74% discount on AirVPN plans. The discount grew with the length of the plan.

The 2020 Black Friday deal structure is expected to be similar.

**AirVPN Black Friday price: Breakdown per month with anticipated Black Friday discount**

* AirVPN **3 year subscription** plan with the Black Friday deal: `99 EUR -> 64.35 EUR` (**1 year free** compared to yearly pricing, or monthly Airvpn cost of **1.79 EUR**)
* AirVPN **2 year subscription** plan with the Black Friday deal: `79 EUR -> 51.35 EUR`
* AirVPN **2 year subscription** plan with the Black Friday deal: `49 EUR -> 31.85 EUR`
