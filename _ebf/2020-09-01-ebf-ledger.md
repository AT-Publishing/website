Ledger wallets go regularly on sale on several times of the year.

The biggest marketing show is made around Black Friday and Cyber monday of course, but the truth is you can get a Ledger wallet discount **roughly once every quarter**.


**Q1**

*Valentines day*. Ledger usually offers new deals on a double pack of the same ledger wallet, or some other bundle deal kind.

**Q2**

*Promo deals for Satoshi Nakamoto's claimed birthday* April 5, 1975.

Random holiday deals or multicolor wallet bundles get discounted too.

**Q3**

*Back to school* discount codes.

*Anniversary of the founding of Ledger Wallet* October 11. A limited edition of a Nano X wallet was released for this occasion in 2019. 

**Q4**

*Promo deals to celebrate the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper* October 31, 2008. Ledger Nano S in special white-colored edition used to be sold in bundle deals.

The November run-up to *Black Friday* deals. Ledger always runs a sequence of different discount offers.

*Christmas deals*.


**Rest of the year: Bundle Discounts**

For the time when Ledger is not running a discount deal or a time-limited coupon, there are often **[bundle deals](#live-ledger)**.
