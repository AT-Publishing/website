### September 2020 Ledger Deal: Ledger Family Pack

`Offer gives 6-21% Discount per ledger wallet`

{{ site.stars.five }}

Ledger wallet keeps with their usual strategy of discounting wallet bundles through the year, and in 2020 we get 3 different Ledger wallet bundles.

You can get multiple Nano S devices, multiple Nano X wallets or the baxkup pack which has one of each.

The discount is higher if your pack has more of Nano S wallets, as the Ledger Nano S is the older product.

##### Why it's good to have more than one hardware wallet

The best way to make use of the Ledger discount code deal is to have as big a total bill as possible:

* You can buy Ledger Nano X to use as your cold-ish storage. The Ledger Nano X is a BluetoothÂ® enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.
* Ledger Nano S is cheaper but can pretty much operate with a single crypto on it only, due to the small memory. That makes it ideal for a single-purpose wallet.
* So, if you trade mostly with, say, Bitcoin as your base currency, Ledger Nano S is the most time-, cost- and security-efficient wallet to serve as your trading wallet.

It's also useful to have a separate wallet for the darknetmarkets. Speaking purely hypothetically of course.
