##### Ledger Wallet early deals in 2018

{{ site.stars.five }}


In 2018, Ledger Wallet opened with the first crypto-related early bird deal, 20% off on **Ledger Nano S** ordered between `October 17 - October 22 2018`.

This campaign was followed on `October 31 2018` with a **limited edition of Ledger Nano S**, themed for the 10 year anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper release by Satoshi Nakamoto.

##### Ledger Wallet Pre-BlackFriday Deals in 2018

Through November 2018, Ledger was running two pre-BlackFriday promo campaigns.

First 2018 Pre-BlackFriday Promo: **Bundle of Nano S color edition**

Ledger made the Nano S available in 6 different colors to address the most common complaint about the Nano S - that its memory is so small that you cannot run multiple wallet apps on it at the same time.

Having different Ledger wallets in different colors proved to make your crypto storage easier to admin. You could actually tell the wallets of different coins apart.

The bundle offer for colored Ledger Nano S had a standard discount structure:

```
20% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 1 Color Edition
30% off on 1 Black Ledger Nano S + 2 or more Color Edition
```

Second 2018 Pre-BlackFriday Promo: **Flat Nano S discount**

The early bird offers of 2018 were finished off with a flat 50% discount on Ledger Nano S.
