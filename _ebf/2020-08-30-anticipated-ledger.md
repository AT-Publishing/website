#### Ledger Nano X Black Friday 2020: Anticipated Site-Wide Discount

{% amp700cloud page.image[0] %}

Every year, Ledger wallet Black Friday deals come in a sequence.

Whereas during the year, crypto hodlers can get a good deal with bundles, on Black Friday Ledger typically does site-wide discounts.

In 2019 the first wave of pre-BlackFriday sale came with 30% off site-wide at Ledger. It was not as low as it could get, but there was enough stock and the discount applied even on Ledger Nano X which was still a new product.

The Ledger Nano X is a BluetoothÂ® enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.

Nano X is still the top product that Ledger has, so we do not expect much hotter deals than 30% off.

#### Ledger Nano S Black Friday 2020: Anticipated 70% Off

{{ site.stars.five }}

Ledger Wallet did the Black Friday 2017 offer of 21% off on your Ledger Ledger Nano S, but in Black Friday 2018, the disount on Nano S went up to 50% discount.

In 2019, Nano S buyers could get it with as much as 60% off, albeit for a short time in a bundle deal.

The pattern is clear however that as the product gets older, the discount in sales events grows. We are anticipating the 2020 Black Friday deal on Ledger Nano S to be around 70% off.
