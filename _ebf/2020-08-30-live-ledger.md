Ledger wallet keeps with their usual strategy of discounting wallet bundles through the year, and in autumn 2020 we get 3 different Ledger wallet bundles.

You can get the new **Ledger Family Pack** (triplet of Nano S wallets or triplet of Nano X wallets) or the classic **Ledger Backup Pack** which has one of each Ledger Nano devices.

Your discount gets higher for packs with Nano S wallets, as the Ledger Nano S is the older product.

##### Why it's good to have more than one hardware wallet

The best way to make use of the Ledger discount code deal is to have as big a total bill as possible:

* **COLD-ISH STORAGE** You can buy Ledger Nano X to use as your cold-ish storage. The Ledger Nano X is a BluetoothÂ® enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.
* **HOT WALLET FOR DAYTRADERS** Ledger Nano S is cheaper but can pretty much operate with a single crypto on it only, due to the small memory. That makes it ideal for a single-purpose wallet.
* **PRACTICAL** So, if you trade mostly with, say, Bitcoin as your base currency, Ledger Nano S is the most time-, cost- and security-efficient wallet to serve as your trading wallet.

It's also useful to have a separate wallet for the darknetmarkets. Speaking purely hypothetically of course.
