**Write a catchy title**

https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfinex/comments/6z1am0/disappearing_eth_deposits_from_smart_contracts_eg/dmsagvi/


### Seriously now: What's the gossip?

**Fiat routes becoming problematic**

The [amazing and reliable everyone's favorite exchange Kraken](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/72jvqi/help_me_leave_kraken_i_have_had_enough_of_their/) (that was sarcasm) started having issues with SEPA. During the last week similar issues also appeared on Bitstamp - SEPA deposits are delayed, especially if you are new. There are speculations the AML/KYC for Euro has been strenghtened and soon retail deposits might become too expensive to handle even with SEPA - the situation we know from [Bitfinex which led them to suspend banking relationships for small traders](https://www.altcointrading.net/bitfinex-banking).

Problems [with USD on Kraken](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72j7ur/kraken_no_longer_allowing_usd_withdraw_for_usa/) have been reported too.

If this turns out to be true it would be a big drawback to dollar-cost averagers and small traders because deposits and withdrawals below mid-5 figures would eventually be stopped on most exchanges. The retail would be left with localbitcoins and p2p only, which is more tedious and also more expensive in terms of dollar price per coin.

**Finex dodging something important**

And of course, the [Tether controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ypy58/the_truth_about_bitfinex_and_tether/) is still alive. In the spirit of general mistrust some people are imagining exchanges might be withholding customer funds to trade with them. Nobody knows whats the truth, if Bitfinex is actually doing something wrong, but nobody can be blamed for inquiring.

The optimistic outlook on the situation is entities like Bitfinex or Bittrex are running a big exchange with new altcoins being listed regularly so there are technical glitches while the support team cannot make it to resolve issues within a few days no matter how many new people the exchange hires.

Come what may, the best thing a retail trader can do is [tightening his security practices](https://www.altcointrading.net/security/), getting secure wallets and stop leaving money on an exchange - not even overnight.
