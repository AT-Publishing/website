CINDX is a new trading platform that appeals to both advanced traders and the crypto newbies.

Currently in the stage of token sale but MVP is already [publicly accessible from the CINDX homepage](http://mvp.cindx.io/registration/sign-in). It is very bare-bones though.

#### About CINDX

CINDX is a trading platform but a big advantage of the project in terms of market liquidity, development speed and security is that it is not a new standalone cryptoasset exchange. Instead of that, CINDX works with user API keys and lets traders execute orders on the cryptocurrency trading platforms they already know and use.

In this aspect, CINDX is similar to platforms like Coinigy but CINDX adds more functionalities on top of aggregated trading and charting. The most anticipated function is the "copytrading" tool, that is gaining popularity among newbie crypto traders who are not content with simple hodling but lack the experience to scalp or open a short in the right time.

On CINDX, participating traders can make their order history visible to the community in order to gain reputation and gain more visibility by publishing tutorials and trading know-how for which they get rewarded as their posts get popular.

Newbie traders then can opt to have their account automatically follow orders of a more experienced trader of their choice.

The CINDX platform and the copied trader both earn fees from successful trades initiated via this functionality. For the inexperienced trader this is a small additional expense but hopefully a smaller one than the "tuition fee" of a string of beginner losses.

There is value in copytrading even for more experienced traders who however have other sources of income beside trading. In strongly trending markets when the profit per trade is bigger it may pay off to copytrade instead of trading on your own during times you know you won't have time to babysit your positions due to traveling or business.

For crypto traders who daytrade and do not have any other business engagements, CINDX is essentially a democratized way to become portfolio managers as with their trading success they will earn fees from the users who copy them.

Last but not least, CINDX also develops a marketplace for analytics and strategies.

#### The CINDX Token

The copytrading system on CINDX runs on Ethereum smart contracts. All initiated trades are recorded on the blockchain for later audit and there are strategies being implemented to detect pump&dump schemes or the potential for market slippage.

The platform received revenue from registration fee, regular subscription fees, success fees and trade fees from the strategy marketplace. The revenue is therefore earned in various cryptocurrencies (BTC, LTC, ETH, tokens...).

The role of the platform's token is not utility, CINX is a security token. The company issuing it is a regulated joint-stock company licensed for running financial business and to issue security tokens.

**The CINX Token (ERC20):**

* The CINX token has capped supply at 51,5 MM. No new tokens will ever be generated.
* All investment and processing operations within the CINDX ecosystem will be implemented strictly in CINX tokens, but Success Fees can be paid in either tokens or in other cryptocurrencies.
* CINX tokens allow users to pay for services in the CINDX and receive rewards for freezing their tokens with smart contracts.
