Everyone who managed to buy the blip to $16 on Bitfinex XMRUSD the other day, good on you! It's time for Monero to rise from the ashes and lure back in all the butthurt ex-holders who got fluffyponied.

[CTO of Ledger](https://reddit.com/u/btchip) says the team determined Monero integration is viable after all. Next step is providing the estimated time to delivery.

u/btchip: *From our current evaluation we're convinced it's doable. Next step will be to provide an ETA.*
