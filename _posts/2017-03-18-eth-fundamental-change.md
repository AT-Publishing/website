Today Alphabay posted an announcement on their [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlphaBayMarket/comments/60355i/alphabay_will_add_etherum_to_its_payment_options/) stating that they are implementing ETH for payments. The implementation should be operational by May 1st 2017.

```
Following the popularity of the new altcoin Ethereum and the recent price
hike showing a growing interest, Alphabay has made the decision to start
accepting Ethereum for marketplace listing purchases.

We are currently laying out the framework to make ETH acceptance possible,
and we will enable Ethereum deposits and withdrawals starting May 1st, 2017.
Vendors wishing to accept Ethereum can edit their listings and set the "Accept
ETH" to "On" in order to be able to be paid in Ethereum.

We have plenty of new stuff in the works, so expect more updates in the near
future.
```

There was some [backlash against this news](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/603xpa/alphabay_market_adding_ethereum_for_payments/df39uks/) since ETH is not currently meant as a cash-like payment system and transactions are easily traceable, as opposed to Monero transactions. However, in the months to come ETH should start support zkSNARKs which would put the transaction privacy on the level with ZCASH.

The abbreviation zk-SNARK means "zero knowledge succinct argument of knowledge".
