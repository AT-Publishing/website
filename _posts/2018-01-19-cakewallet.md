While [Coinomi is still testing out its Monero integration](https://twitter.com/kimionis/status/954112970338029570), there is another app the name of which begs for the worst of puns: [Cakewallet for iOS is out](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cake-wallet-for-xmr-monero/id1334702542?mt=8). The app is [legitimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7ri9v8/our_monero_wallet_called_cakewallet_for_ios_is/) and available for free.

The developer of the app is responding to [user feedback on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7ri9v8/our_monero_wallet_called_cakewallet_for_ios_is/) and will opensource the codebase of Cakewallet soon.
