Apparently, the newly launched ETH trading on Bitstamp comes with an unpleasant surprise: If you withdraw ETH, the withdrawal is processed via a smart contract (which is not indicated on the withdrawal page).

If you happen to withdraw from Bitstamp to Bitfinex, your deposit will be confirmed on the blockchain but your money will not be ex doesn't accept deposits from smart contract.

They'll still receive the money though. The money you couldn't know was sent via a smart contract.

What a time to be alive.

The support is at Poloniex level at the moment: too many users having the same issue, no tickets resolved. Main thing is we have a new frontend interface boys!
