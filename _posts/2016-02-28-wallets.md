____________________

You must be reading this all the time, but still: Never keep untrader coins on [an altcoin exchange](/altcoin-exchanges/) and never send coins from one exchange to another.

#### Hardware Altcoin Wallets

If you want to hold an altcoin that you think should grow in the future, you should get either wallet as a software or a hardware wallet.

{% amp700 border {{page.image[6]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}

  * {% aff Ledger Wallet https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/e274 %} used to claim they would not support any altcoins but they added support for several of them in 2017. A Ledger Nano can act as a BTC wallet, an Ethereum wallet, it also stores DASH, ZCASH, Stratis and other altcoins via their companion apps.
  * {% aff Trezor https://shop.trezor.io?a=fany@tutanota.com %} natively supports BTC, ETH, DASH, LTC and ZCASH after [update in January 2017](https://www.altcointrading.net/trezor-multicoin/).

{{ site.ads.trezor }}

#### Electrum for Litecoin

Get it {% aff here https://electrum-ltc.org/ %} (official website). It is a regular Electrum wallet, still with the privacy flaw of being able to tell which pool of addresses belong to a single wallet.

#### Electrum for Dash

Another Electrum flavor is Dash wallet. You can get it from {% aff Dash homepage https://www.dash.org/downloads %}.

#### MyMonero Web Wallet

**[mymonero.com](https://mymonero.com/#/)**

This is something that is actually endorsed on the getmonero.com website.

MyMonero is website that will get you a Monero address, sign up pretty much takes one click. You click the one and only button on the landing page and in thenext step it is already showing you your private login key:

> *Below this you will find your thirteen word "Private Login Key". Keeping this secure and private is very important, as it is the only way that you will be able to login to your MyMonero account. As we don't store your private login key on the server there is no way to recover it if it is lost!*

The next step is already your web wallet:

Pretty impressive, the drawback is you have to enter your private key at every login. It wouldn't top a Monero light client, if it existed.

#### Desktop Multi-Altcoin Wallets

{% amp700 border {{page.image[2]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}


The best and most popular multicoin wallet these days is [Jaxx](https://jaxx.io/support.html). It is available as browser extension, desktop app and mobile app - although the choice of supported coins differs.

User-friendliness level is the top of top - you launch the software and wallets are automatically generated for you. To get the private keys you need to run backup. In all versions, the only owner of the private keys is you.

After the recent update to Jaxx 1.2 you get [Shapeshift](https://shapeshift.io/) onboard as well.

{% amp700 border {{page.image[7]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}


**Supported coins:** BTC, ETH, ETC, DASH, LTC, REP, RSK, ZEC

In the future, Jaxx aims to be [blockchain-agnostic](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/jaxx-aims-to-be-blockchain-agnostic-with-more-new-coin-integrations-1473282178/) though.

{% amp700 border {{page.image[3]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}

_This is the first launch screen of Jaxx. The very next step will take you directly to your wallets._

{% amp700 border {{page.image[4]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}

_If you want to withdraw into your wallet you can simply copy the address it wil give you:_

{% amp700 border {{page.image[5]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}


Don't forget to backup the seed of your JAXX wallet (under settings on the right hand side) should your computer crash.

If you are looking for an Ethereum wallet Jaxx is probably your best option in 2017.

However, if you also want to exchange one altcoin for another without sending your coins to Poloniex you could like {% aff Exodus https://www.exodus.io/ %} better than Jaxx. Exodus is a desktop multiwallet that integrates Shapeshift in it so you can do basic spot trading right from the desktop client. Exodus only supports BTC, LTC, DASH, ETH and DOGE though.


#### Web Based Multi-Altcoin Wallets

For altcoin trading you will be best off with a multi-currency wallet. Go for {% aff Cryptonator https://www.cryptonator.com/about %}. It can hold litecoins, dash, bitcoin and other coins. You will also be able to generate addresses as you go.
