You must be reading this all the time, but still: Never keep untrader coins on an exchange and never send coins from one exchange to another.

#### Hardware Altcoin Wallets

If you want to hold an altcoin that you think should grow in the future, you should get either wallet as a software or a hardware wallet.

  * {% aff Ledger Wallet https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/e274 %} said they will not support any altcoins.
  * {% aff Trezor https://buytrezor.com?a=fany@tutanota.com %} on the other hand supports Electrum wallet which also has Dash and Litecoin integration. There is a full {% aff Trezor https://buytrezor.com?a=fany@tutanota.com %} integration now so you can hold bitcoins, litecoins and dash on a single {% aff Trezor https://buytrezor.com?a=fany@tutanota.com %} device.

{{ site.ads.trezor }}

#### Electrum for Litecoin

Get it {% aff here https://electrum-ltc.org/ %} (official website). It is a regular Electrum wallet, still with the privacy flaw of being able to tell which pool of addresses belong to a single wallet.

#### Electrum for Dash

Another Electrum flavor is Dash wallet. You can get it from {% aff Dash homepage https://www.dash.org/downloads %}.

#### MyMonero Web Wallet

**[mymonero.com](https://mymonero.com/#/)**

This is something that is actually endorsed on the getmonero.com website.

MyMonero is website that will get you a Monero address, sign up pretty much takes one click. You click the one and only button on the landing page and in thenext step it is already showing you your private login key:

> *Below this you will find your thirteen word "Private Login Key". Keeping this secure and private is very important, as it is the only way that you will be able to login to your MyMonero account. As we don't store your private login key on the server there is no way to recover it if it is lost!*

The next step is already your web wallet:

Pretty impressive.

#### Desktop Multi-Altcoin Wallets

{% amp700 border {{page.image[2]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}


The best and most popular multicoin wallet these days is [Jaxx](https://jaxx.io/support.html). It is available as browser extension, desktop app and mobile app - although the choice of supported coins differs.

User-friendliness level is the top of top - you launch the software and wallets are automatically generated for you. To get the private keys you need to run backup. In all versions, the only owner of the private keys is you.

**Supported coins:** BTC, ETH, ETC, DSH, LTC, REP, RSK, ZEC

In the future, Jaxx aims to be [blockchain-agnostic](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/jaxx-aims-to-be-blockchain-agnostic-with-more-new-coin-integrations-1473282178/) though.

{% amp700 border {{page.image[3]}} {{page.image_alt[0]}} %}

_This is the first launch screen of Jaxx. The very next step will take you directly to your wallets._

#### Web Based Multi-Altcoin Wallets
