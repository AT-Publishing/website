There has been a [discussion on /r/bitfinex](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfinex/comments/7kzo4c/referral_link_ticket_answered_in_41_min_missing/) about new people not being able to get their referral link to become Bitfinex representatives.

For the people who have been already active representatives, new signups stopped being granted last week.

In this case the support is responsive, and here is what they have to say:

> The Bitfinex referral program has been discontinued. This means that affiliates will no longer be able to sign up new users and receive commission on the fees charged.

> We are currently working on a new program whereby existing users will be able to invite a limited group of new users to sign-up or the Bitfinex platform. Once this has been finalized then we will notify existing users who qualify with details regarding this program.
At this time , and until such a time as the new program is operational we will not be accepting new users to the platform.

-- There still hasn't been a formal announcement but it is apparent from the mail that Bitfinex stopped new user registrations. That's a second big exchange after [Bittrex did that on December 15th](https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003463331-New-Account-Sign-Ups).
