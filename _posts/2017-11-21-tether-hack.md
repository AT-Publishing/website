Tether has issued an emergency notice stating that more than 30 millions of newly generated tethers have been stolen by an unknown malicious hacker.

[https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement/](https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement/)

On the notice, the price of some cryptocurrencies dropped sharply (mainly BTC and also IOTA, which is mostly traded at Bitfinex, company related to Tether via Tether's owning company). The markets have since seen a recovery.
