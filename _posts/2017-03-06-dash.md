The tradingview cryptocurrency chat mod lowstrife posted his chart in January 2017 when DASH was showing something that looked like long term accumilation before a jump.

> *This is extremely promising market structure for DASH, very well defined highs that have been hit multiple times. I could see a serious run attempt at 0.1 in the coming months if it continues to provide. I'm a bit late on my timing, I would have liked to publish this chart around 0.0012, but as long as it continues to make higher lows on the high timeframes it should be setup for a very nice run. 3 years of consolidation bewteen 0.005 and 0.03, the trend is sideways but with an upward bias.*

By the beginning of March DASH peaked around 0.048 BTC and started wicking hard which was pronounced the end of the bull run:

> *Wow, gigantic wicks and margin calls. Close everything, this is the top.*

We are now ripe for another consolidation.

This is a short position from the top based on RSI (overbought and declining) and MACD "bad squishy". However, the prediction was more bearish than the reality, DASH seems to be consolidating sideways.
