Quite briefly: The year 2017 is coming to a close and everyone is publishing 'top 10 altcoin picks' for the next year as if there was only tomorrow and no yesterday. Here is a list of all altcoins that were launched during 2017 - taken from [bitinfocharts](https://bitinfocharts.com/new-cryptocurrencies-2017.html) on 19th of December - [archive link](http://archive.is/TQjvW). They are ordered by that days trading volume in USD and there are some remarks to the top 20 of them. You'll have some info about the platform these are on, what is their value proposition and how tradeable they are. And you'll see the list is very consistent with the fleeting mentality of the markets - since pretty much everything is just speculative most volume are getting the relatively new coins which happen to be the ones that don't really do TA (yet?). The coins that were the rage half a year ago are kind of forgotten - with the exception of bitcoin forks.
