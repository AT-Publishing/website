Lately Kraken has been the last exchange you'd recommend for trading - bitcoin or altcoins all the same.

The selection of markets was extremely good. The very limited reliability of their infrastructure was a dealbreaker though and the awful, awful<sup>awful<sup>awful</sup></sup> charts were only adding insult to injury.

People on Reddit even set up a joint thread "[I too got fucked by Kraken](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/5vwgye/i_too_got_fucked_by_kraken_general_thread/)" just this February.

Today however Kraken announced they acquired Cryptowatch, currently the most popular cryptocurrency charting engine.

The interface is available at [trade.kraken.com](https://trade.kraken.com/kraken/ethbtc) accessible to all Kraken users. At the moment the functionality is the same as **the old Cryptowatch Premium** access. Nothing changes for people who don't trade at Kraken, standard Cryptowatch is still available for free to everyone as it was.

Artur Sapek, [the developer of Cryptowatch, says](https://cryptowat.ch/announcement/kraken-acquires-cryptowatch) we can look forward to faster development of the charting platform as the work with Kraken will bring in some capital.

That's helluva good news for today.
