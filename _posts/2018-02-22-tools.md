#### Crypto Trading Bots

* [Coinrule](http://bit.ly/coinrulebot) (free/premium)

For a fully automated TA-based trading, try the [Coinrule bot](http://bit.ly/coinrulebot). The interface is user friendly and intuitive. No coding required to write your trading strategy, no coding needed even to backtest it.

Coinrule is free for traded volumes below 3K USD per month. It's good enough to test it, for after that **get your 25% off with [this link](http://bit.ly/coinrulebot).** Paid plans start at 29.9 USD per month, depending on your volume and number of active strategies.

Coinrule supports bot trading on big exchanges like **Binance, Bitstamp, Kraken, [Bitfinex](http://bit.ly/the-cat-mouse-game), OKEx** and more.

The company is based in London and has been around since 2016, but stayed under the radar due to the noise generated by the ICO bubble.

They did use that time to build their product as well as an extensive knowledge base. If nothing else, check at least that.

{% amp700cloud page.image[5] %}

* [TensorCharts](https://bit.ly/at-tc-2020) - Paid

Tensorcharts is a charting app with **orderbook heatmap and segmented candlesticks** for crypto and legacy markets.

TensorCharts are not free. There is a basic free plan that gives you the coloured candles, orderbook visualisation and basic data refresh (not fully realtime but good enough). You will not be able to view the full [volume profile](/glossary/volume-trading/) and access most functionalities that are data-intensive and therefore costly.

If you are not sure you are willing to pay for this stuff, you can piece together a **poor man's tensorcharts alternative** on [TradingView](https://bit.ly/at-tvd-btcusd).

* Make a chart at [TradingView FREE](https://bit.ly/at-tvd-btcusd)
* Go to Indicators and script and search for ["Poor man's volume profile", a free VPVR alternative](/glossary/vpvr/). Apply it.
* Next look up "[ST] Volume Flow v6" by spacetrader, which colors your candles based on changes in volume. It colours full candles as a whole, the data is less granular than footprint candles. But it's free.

There hasn't been a lot of apps that track the network activity of cryptocurrencies, even though [fundamental metrics such as transactions per day, fees, mempool size or transactions per block have correlation with the price of bitcoin](/strategy/crypto-market-psychology/).
