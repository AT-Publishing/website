Here is an excerpt from the [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC) [announcement](https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/223/review):

In the event of a hard fork that results in a chain split, Bitfinex is also faced with the challenge of resolving peer-to-peer financing issues. Because we have sufficient time to plan for this event we have elected to handle the accounting of peer-to-peer financed trading similar to how stock spinoffs, dividends, and distributions are handled in equity markets.

Specifically, in the case of a hard fork event, **lenders will receive both BTC and B2X**. Anyone that is **short BTC/USD or long any BTC trading pair (ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, etc.) will owe B2X** to the lender, effectively making the user short B2X.

An exception is being made where **BTC is borrowed but is not in use** as financing collateral. In that case, **B2X will accrue to the lender, [not the borrower]**. Users that are financed long BTC/USD or short any BTC trading pair will receive B2X.

[Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC) staff will be available on **Whalepool Teamspeak and Bitcoin Mumble** servers from time to time to answer customer questions. We will also be building a FAQ document to clarify edge cases and other nuances as needed.

In case you missed the news, you can now also trade chain-split tokens (CST) for SegWit2X - or at least follow their price action for price discovery information.
