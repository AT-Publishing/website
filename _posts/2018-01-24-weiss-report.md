Weiss Ratings is the US leading independent rating agency of financial institutions. They are due to publish their letter grades rating of several cryptocurrencies on January 24 at 8 AM UTC. [Subscribe to their mailing list to receive the report as soon as it's out](http://finance.weissratings.com/crypto/).

Weiss will rate not only the market leaders such as BTC or ETH but they will also analyze the altcoins that are the flavour of the month - potentially overhyped vaporware. In their announcement they mentioned cryptocoins such as Ripple, Cardano, Stellar, EOS, TRON or Bitcoin Gold but they also added many other cryptocurrencies will be included.

Traders expect the ratings to be rather negative, in the best case scenario negative only for cryptocoins that are mainly valued based on *promising tech* backed by nothing more than a cute landing page. However, the headline on weissratings.com actually explains the grades are meant to identify *the most promising cryptocurrencies* which goes to show how one-sided marketing still runs the crypto show in 2018. Some traders are naturally expecting a fresh dose of turmoil in the currently choppy markets.

This post will be updated later with new information.
