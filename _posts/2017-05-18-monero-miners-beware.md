After WannaCry, UIWIX Ransomware and Monero-Mining Malware Follow Suit.

WannaCry ransomware’s outbreak during the weekend was mitigated by having its kill switch domain registered. It was only a matter of time, however, for other cybercriminals to follow suit. Case in point: the emergence of UIWIX ransomware (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_UIWIX.A) and one notable Trojan our sensors detected.
