Augur was once called "troubled token" by [Coindesk](http://www.coindesk.com/augur-reputation-launch-appcoin-pitfalls/).

Augur development got funded from an ICO. Once the trading started on Poloniex the price dumped much as people took their ICO profits. The downtrend didn't start reversing until the start of 2017, both the market cap and the dollar value has been firmly rising since. The BTC pair price is almost flat as the BTC value keeps (mostly) rising this year.

#### What's been new?

Was there something fundamental that could facilitate this rise?

* Augur actually got the prediction platform, [https://app.augur.net/](https://app.augur.net/)

#### Appcoins

There's something about it that all crypto is a form of collective prediction setup.

On Augur people get paid for predicting. In Bitcoin and Ethereum miners get paid for contributing with computing power. But Bitcoin has a utility as a store of value and niche means of payment while Ethereum is the platform for decentralized development.

Is there actual demand for a cryptocurrency branded betting market though?

A stock is a contract between owners of an enterprise which grants its bearers the right to a portion of the liquidation value of the company and to any dividends that it offers. Consequently, there is a reason to expect growth of the company to increase the price of its stock.

**On the other hand, the value of an appcoin can move completely independently of the value of the app itself.**
