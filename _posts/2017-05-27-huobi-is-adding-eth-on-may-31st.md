Huobi announced an announcement this morning (fluffypony style!), the actual news came soon after from @cnLedger.

Many had high hopes for the withdrawal situation update -- but it's "just" ETH trading.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Huobi has millions of users in China. Up to now none of the &quot;big 3&quot; listed any coins except BTC &amp; LTC. Many CN traders are unaware of ETH <a href="https://t.co/Wdd8sE8WuG">https://t.co/Wdd8sE8WuG</a></p>&mdash; cnLedger (@cnLedger) <a href="https://twitter.com/cnLedger/status/868457182429233155">May 27, 2017</a></blockquote>

People [still cannot withdraw coins from major Chinese exchanges](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-withdrawals-expected-to-resume-as-chinese-exchanges-ask-users-for-funds-info) but the BTC and LTC premium started diminishing on rumors the withdrawals might be resumed in June.  

There was a letter shared via @cnLedger saying the exchanges were not asked to suspend withdrawals, that they did that on their own accord:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PBoC reply to BTC user: we did not ask trading platforms to suspend w/d. It was a decision made by themselves. The inspection has not ended. <a href="https://t.co/mi3IxXR93g">pic.twitter.com/mi3IxXR93g</a></p>&mdash; cnLedger (@cnLedger) <a href="https://twitter.com/cnLedger/status/867651423038603264">May 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

...Surely they were asked nicely.

Either way, Huobi is the first major exchange to list ETH. That could mean a boost for the coin as new wave of speculators (and bots) chimes in. [Don't forget more than 50% of the volume on the now-zero-fee Japanese exchange Bitflyer is done by three monster-bots only](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6deopl/daily_discussion_friday_may_26_2017/di3fto6/) - the volatility there was insane.

[OkCoin had a big announcement too this week](http://blog.okcoin.com/post/161088088064/okcoin-to-migrate-futures-activity-to-okexcom) as they announced the migration to a new platform OKEx (coins-only, no fiat hence possibly less intervention) but no word about new altcoin implementations.
