Decentralized games are facing the same challenge as the rest of the dApp industry - declining user base. As [reported by diar.co](http://diar.co/decentralized-apps-facing-half-life-after-peak/), even the most popular decentralized game CryptoKitties suffered a decline of 96% in terms of active users measured by unique active ETH addresses. The reason for poor user retention according to Diar is unintuitive multi-step user experience, a crucial issue that even in the future could make finding new adopters difficult.

An intuitive solution [also highlighted by Andrew Gazdecki of Altcoin.io](https://www.altcointrading.net/interview-andrew-gazdecki/) is sharing of liquidity: Blockchain projects should not silo their apps, they should instead engage in liquidity pooling and support collaboration among different blockchain assets.

The blockchain game [Etheremon](https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/company/etheremon/) is the first decentralized gaming platform that made this step to make the dApp game more accessible and partnered with [Kyber Network](https://kyber.network/). The integration launched on Tuesday 18th September 2018 at noon UTC.

#### Leveraging Kyber Network in Blockchain Gaming

Kyber Network developed an on-chain liquidity protocol that allows decentralized token swaps to be integrated into any application.

Kyber Network supports atomic token swaps with immediate settlement, effectively removing transaction waiting time. With this integration value exchange can be performed seamlessly between all parties in the ecosystem.

While the one application that comes first in mind is decentralized trading, in the most general way Kyber Network makes it possible to use any ERC-20 token where a platform-specific token would otherwise be necessary.

In the world of game dApps where every game has its own in-game currency this is a substantial improvement in usability for users who play more than one blockchain game.  Kyber Network integration means they can access gaming dApps using any ERC-20 token, no need to hold and manage segregated in-game funds for each dApp game they play.

It is expected among the most popular tokens to use in Etheremon will be [Zilliqa (ZIL)](https://www.thebusinessofcrypto.com/company/zilliqa/) and Basic Attention Token (BAT).

#### Advantage in the Crowded Blockchain Gaming Industry

According to DappRadar.com, decentralized games are among the most popular dApps overall. CryptoKitties currently rank fourth and Etheremon fifth on the [leaderboard of all dApps on the Ethereum blockchain](https://dappradar.com/dapps).

As of September 2018 the [total number of active dApp games is around 350](https://dappradar.com/category/games). This demonstrates not only the soaring engagement with blockchain from the gaming community but also the increasing competitiveness of the blockchain gaming industry.

Making the game token management easier could quickly prove to be a strong advantage. With no need to exchange tokens, users are ready to play at any time they decide so. Thanks to Kyber's atomic swaps with instant settlement there is no waiting time necessary as there would be with the traditional token exchange methods.

**In the business of entertainment, it is risky to let the player's interest wane in wait for transaction confirmation. And conversely: When deciding between several dApp games, we could see players prioritize the most accessible one.**
