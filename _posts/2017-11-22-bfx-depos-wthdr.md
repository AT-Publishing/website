[From bfx_drew on Reddit:](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7ef1bo/daily_discussion_tuesday_november_21_2017/dq63pqt/)

Couple new things at Bitfinex --

* Individual users can now access USD wires for deposits and withdrawals
* Euro wires added for both corporate and individual accounts
* First Euro trading pair, [/t/BTC:EUR](https://www.bitfinex.com/t/BTC:EUR/?refcode=5egV78YtlC), now live.

To the delays in crypto withdrawals, bfx_drew said:

> Withdrawals should be speeding up now. First, there was a delay in refilling hot wallet due to travel on behalf of a couple of the signers, then it is taking a while to work through the queue, requiring frequent refilling of hot wallet.

**Update:**

According to [this screenshot taken from 4chan](https://image.prntscr.com/image/M3xDGd1kRbuN2Nue214ULg.png), Bitfinex is using a Polish bank for their EUR wires. The bank is called Bank Spółdzielczy w Skierniewicach (BS Skierniewice) [https://www.bsskierniewice.pl/](https://www.bsskierniewice.pl/) and it is not a well known, big institute. It has triggered a [wave of mistrust on the Cryptocurrency subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7entmf/upvote_gtfo_of_bitfinex_and_maybe_bitcoin_in/).

*This post will be further amended once there is more information available.*

**Update December 17, 2017**, all money movements are problematic at the moment as Bitfinex has been under an on-and-off DDoS attack for about a week now. This is just a technical problem not related to any kind of banking issues. New user registrations are temporarily disabled too.
