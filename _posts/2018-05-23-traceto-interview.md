Q: The traceto.io whitepaper mentions your client base of 200 crypto organizations (through Cynopsis Solutions) as part of your competitive edge: from what you can share, what are the issues these organizations struggle with the most in terms of AML/KYC? Do some aspects of traceto.io come from their suggestions or direct feedback?

A: We actually have about 600 clients through Cynopsis - the 200 figure is just the crypto and blockchain business clients we’ve worked with. Most of our crypto clients consist of very entrepreneurial technologists who often are not very familiar with AML and KYC regulations. This is a big challenge for most of them. The lack of a decentralised KYC platform drove us to form traceto.io after discussing the idea with many of our strategic clients.

Q: Why is a KYC system on the blockchain with a utility token a better solution than having a traditional system storing encrypted information in a database, operated by trusted employees?

A: I think the question should be expanded slightly to: why is a KYC system on blockchain better than    traditional system. There are 3 main reasons:

1) Censorship resistance

No individual or business should be arbitrarily denied access to KYC services. KYC services are currently dominated by several big players using expensive and relatively inefficient centralised systems; if businesses are denied access to such services, they are exposed to the risk of being non-compliant with the relevant regulations - which can have very severe and expensive consequences.

2) Sovereignty/ownership over personal data

End users should not have to give their info to every new ICO or exchange. Currently, end users send their photographs and passport scans to every ICO and exchange they participate in, which increases the exposure they have to data breaches and rogue employees. Under the traceto.io model, the user maintains control over his own data; the decentralised nature of the traceto.io network means that there is no need to trust any 3rd party KYC companies and their employees. The centralised nature of existing KYC solutions obviously also presents a single point of failure and are more vulnerable to hacking.

3) The requirement for network nodes to perform compliance tasks

Staking, slashing and other reward mechanisms performed by contracts instead of arbitrary authority are integrated into the traceto.io platform. Human verifiers will support dispute resolution, suspicious transaction reporting and other KYC subtasks. We have designed compelling cryptoeconomic incentive mechanisms to facilitate node operators to drive these processes.


Q: Question about the customer privacy - the whitepaper mentions that traceto.io will be able to assess credit worthiness or detect fraud based on transactions associated with the user wallet address. What are your policies regarding the sharing of  this kind of customer data?

A: Credit assessment is a future phase in our roadmap as we see a close nexus between KYC and credit risk. Transaction monitoring is a key component of KYC and we intend to provide this crucial aspect of service to partner exchanges, wallets and platform providers. We will not share this information without first obtaining explicit permission from our users, the relevant exchanges and wallets we work with.

Q: The way traceto.io’s KYC works is that the identity of a customer is verified primarily via the traceto.io community of carefully selected people who stake the utility token and work as verifiers to earn more T2T. The personal data of the customer is stored encrypted within traceto.io and available to the crypto businesses who request the verification only on request. Is this a legally acceptable model for instance for exchanges - to not store the customer data?

A: Verification of identity is only one part of KYC. We propose a framework that provides a good coverage of compliance regulations. This revolves around four key guiding questions;  (1) “Who are you?” (2) “Who are you not?” (3) “What did you do?” And (4) “Are you still who you say you are?”

The first question is “Who are you?” It involves the verification of identity -- proof that a person is the self-- same as that in his identity document.

The second question is "Who are you not?" It deals with the screening of unsavory individuals, such as terrorists, money launderers and other financial criminals.

The third question is  "What did you do?". It reflects the ongoing due diligence process that has to be carried out over time -- transaction monitoring is part of this process.

The final question is  "Are you still who you say you are?" It ties in all 3 questions with the progression of time.

The obligation for an exchange is to perform necessary due diligence to combat money laundering and terrorism financing in general.  Typically, the rules in most countries provide for performance of due diligence by a third party intermediary and generally, the requirement on record keeping does not dictate that the exchange must store customer data themselves. In our model, we entrust the storage of private keys to Personal Identifiable Information (PII) back to the users themselves with an multi-signatory approach where the exchange and a combination of a quorum of community verifiers will be able to grant access to the exchange for legitimate purposes such as regulatory enquiries. We’ll be releasing details of this mechanism in due course.   

Q: What is the advantage of traceto.io for crypto businesses that already go through KYC using other traditional methods? How difficult and costly would it be to make the transition from traditional KYC methods to Traceto?

A: There are not many traditional methods for KYC at the moment. The current standard for KYC services in the cryptocurrency space is quite low, as compared to that of the real-world. For ICOs and exchanges that make use of KYC, the KYC processes generally consists of a matching selfie and a passport. More compliant businesses may purchase a Anti Money Laundering (AML) screening solution, such as the Artemis software provided by Cynopsis Solutions, our parent company.

The standard for KYC services is likely to increase to converge with the current standards that exist in other traditional or established industries. Many existing real-world processes are missing in the current crypto landscape. For example, transaction monitoring, which is the analysis and risk assessment of transactions by a business's end user, is generally unheard of amongst crypto businesses. We believe that the regulatory standards in the crypto-world will only become more stringent and that many of these standards will evolve to mimic or complement real-world procedures.

traceto.io offers a complete KYC/AML utility platform rather than the standalone databases offered by many other providers. Experience in the banking sector clearly shows that future remediation costs incurred by businesses that try save costs by “dodging” regulatory requirements can be very significant - so getting the right KYC/AML processes in place from the outset is always the better option. Compliance in the blockchain sector is really no different.
