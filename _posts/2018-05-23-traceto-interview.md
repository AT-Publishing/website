About Chye Kit

....

> The way traceto.ioâ€™s KYC works is that the identity of a customer is verified primarily via the traceto.io community of carefully selected people who stake the utility token and work as verifiers to earn more T2T. The personal data of the customer is stored encrypted within traceto.io and available to the crypto businesses who request the verification only on request. Is this a legally acceptable model for instance for exchanges - to not store the customer data?


__________

**The traceto.io whitepaper mentions as one part of your competitive edge that you already have a client base of 200 organizations through Cynopsis Solutions. What are the issues businesses in the blockchain industry struggle with the most? Do some aspects of traceto.io come from your clients' suggestions and direct feedback?**

We actually have about 600 clients through Cynopsis in total. It is about 200 out of them that operate in the crypto and blockchain business.

Typically, our crypto clients will be very entrepreneurial people who focus on the technology and are not very familiar with AML and KYC regulations. This is an important aspect of their business but at the same time it is a big challenge for most of them.

We also have several strategic clients, though. The lack of a decentralized KYC platform drove us to form traceto.io after discussing the idea with some of them.

**Why is a KYC system on the blockchain necessary then? Would it not be enough to use a database, to encrypt all data before storing and to only have trusted employees deal with the critical business?**

A blockchain-based KYC system is better than traditional system for businesses that need the advantage it provides. There main advantages are censorship resistance and sovereignty over the data, but another important one is the role of the network nodes. It is the nodes that perform the compliance tasks, not some arbitrary authority.



///Staking, slashing and other reward mechanisms performed by contracts instead of arbitrary authority are integrated into the traceto.io platform. Human verifiers will support dispute resolution, suspicious transaction reporting and other KYC subtasks. We have designed compelling cryptoeconomic incentive mechanisms to facilitate node operators to drive these processes.



**You mention censorship resistance, which is I'm afraid quite an abused buzzword. Does it really matter for today's crypto businesses?**

What I meant is that no business or individual should be denied access to a KYC solution. Currently the market for KYC services is dominated by several big players. They are established but they use expensive and less efficient, centralized solutions.

So for cost reasons it can happen that certain companies or individuals are arbitrarily denied the possibility to set up a KYC system or to complete a KYC procedure, which is obviously a problem. If businesses are denied access, they are exposed to the risk of being non-compliant with the relevant regulations, which can have very severe and expensive consequences.

**That makes a good case perhaps for smaller businesses or for blockchain projects that are just starting up. How about companies that are already using some traditional KYC solution? How difficult and costly would it be to make the transition from traditional KYC methods to Traceto?**

This is rather a question of compliance. My experience in the banking sector shows very clearly that the remediation costs incurred by businesses that try save costs by sidestepping regulatory requirements can be very significant. Having the most complete compliance solution in place is simply always the better option, in this regard the blockchain industry is really no different from the banking sector.

Currently, the KYC standard in the cryptocurrency space is relatively low. For ICOs and exchanges the KYC processes usually only consist of matching a selfie to a passport. Some businesses may purchase an Anti Money Laundering screening solution - Cynopsis provides the Artemis software for AML. For now though, the crypto space KYC is generally still missing a lot of elements that are common in traditional industries.

For instance, the analysis and risk assessment of transactions by a business's end user - that is, transaction monitoring. With the exception of the largest blockchain businesses transaction monitoring is generally unheard of amongst crypto companies but it is the regulatory standard in any traditional industry, not just in financial services.

In the future we expect the blockchain industry KYC standard to increase and eventually converge with the current standard of mature industries. Traceto offers a complete KYC/AML utility platform rather than simple data storage solution. Considering the likely future development of the blockchain sector this is an important advantage.

**Going back to how the ownership of the data. If I recall correctly from the whitepaper, sovereignty over the data is meant in the sense that the users themselves will gain more control over what is happening with the personal information they provide when they verify their identity?**

It minimizes the risks the customer needs to take with centralized solutions. These days users send their passport scans and proofs of address to each company separately, some companies also outsource KYC to third parties. Each of these companies manages private data on its own, that means there is a substantial exposure of the customer to the risk of data breach or abuse from rogue employees. The users should simply not need to submit their documents to different exchanges or ICOs over and over again.

Under the Traceto model users never lose control over their own data. The network is decentralized, there is no need to trust any company or their employees and the security aspect is also improved. The centralized nature of existing KYC solutions obviously presents a single point of failure which makes it more vulnerable to hacking.

**But with your solution, the Traceto platform manages all the user data and on top of that also has the knowledge of all ICO investments and overall transaction activity of the identified user. The whitepaper even names this kind of activity monitoring as the basis to establish the user's credit score. That is a lot of private information - what are your policies regarding user privacy?**

The credit assessment is a feature planned for a more distant phase in our roadmap as we get closer to the nexus between KYC and credit risk in the blockchain industry.

Transaction monitoring of customers already is a key KYC component, it is nothing new and we simply intend to provide this crucial aspect of service to partner exchanges, wallets and platform providers. We will not share this information without first obtaining explicit permission from the user and the relevant exchange or wallet we work with.

**The personal data of the customer is stored encrypted within traceto.io and available to the crypto businesses who request the verification only on request. Is this a legally acceptable model for instance for exchanges - to not store the customer data?**

The particular laws might slightly differ from country to country but cryptocurrency exchanges always have the obligation to perform due diligence to combat money laundering and terrorism financing in general. Typically, the rules in most countries allow for performance of due diligence by a third party intermediary and generally, the requirement on record keeping does not dictate that the exchange must store customer data themselves.

In our model, we entrust the storage of private keys to Personal Identifiable Information (PII) back to the users themselves with a multi-signature approach. That means the exchange can request customer information from Traceto for legitimate purposes, such as regulatory enquiries. The request then can be granted by a quorum of community verifiers that have incentive to behave honestly.

We will be releasing details of this mechanism in due course but on the surface level, we propose a four-part framework that involves the initial verification of identity and screening for criminal activity combined with ongoing due diligence processes that have to be carried out over time - such as transaction monitoring and making sure the monitored address stays in the ownership of the same person over time.
