Ichimoku cloud is available on both [cryptowat.ch](https://cryptowat.ch/) and [TradingView](http://tradingview.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=3223&url_id=23&file_id=199).

Since you're here you probably have the idea what the cloud is but here's a good definition from [Stockcharts on Ichimoku cloud](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:ichimoku_cloud):

> Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates into “one look equilibrium chart”. With one look, chartists can identify the trend and look for potential signals within that trend. The indicator was developed by Goichi Hosoda, a journalist, and published in his 1969 book. Even though the Ichimoku Cloud may seem complicated when viewed on the price chart, it is really a straight forward indicator that is very usable. It was, after all, created by a journalist, not a rocket scientist!

Ichimoku cloud gets used by many cryptocurrency traders but it's almost never used in its default setting. The default setting is crafted for markets that only open Monday to Friday, whereas crypto trades all the time -- [more about the Ichimoku cloud settings for crypto here](#settings).

#### Lines on Ichimoku cloud explained like you're five

{% amp700 border {{page.image[1]}} %}

Ichimoku cloud uses past action of the market to predict future most likely direction along with support and resistance lines.
It is calculated from past EMAs and highs vs lows, among other things, [here's more if you need to know](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:ichimoku_cloud).

The number of lines is confusing but here's the basic info you need to know:

* The Senkou span are the borders of the (here) green cloud. It is green in this case as the market is bullish. It will be red in bearish markets. The space between the lines is called kumo. Senkou spans are major support/resistance lines - people set their stop orders on them because once the trend breaks through both of them, a reversal should come.
* Kinjun and Tenken lines are "balance" lines - [fast and slow EMAs](http://www.babypips.com/school/elementary/moving-averages/moving-average-crossover-trading.html). If the price keeps around them, it is not overhyped nor underpriced. If it gets distant it is changing direction way faster than it "should" and a pullback is likely. In such a case, people set stop-loss orders around the lines if they are in a position and don't want to take profits until necessary.
* The Chinkou line is a lagging indicator. You can use it to confirm a trend.

#### Ichimoku cloud settings for crypto trading

Because Ichimoku cloud takes the past action to predict the most likely future ranges and breaking points, traders want to reflect the past action as precisely as possible. Ichimoku works with timely moving averages, so most of all it's important to set meaningful timespans considering the fact that cryptocurrencies trade 24/7/365.

The default parameters of the cloud are 9, 26, 52, 26 but you will mostly find that crypto traders set them to 20, 30, 120, 60.

Originaly Ichimoku settings (9, 26, 52, 26) represents parameter by parameter:

* 9 represents a week and a half of trading
* 26 equals the number of trading days in a typical month (30 minus four Sundays)
* 52 equals two months of trading days

For cryptocurrencies the market is open all the time, so the math goes:  
* 7+3.5 = 10 (because of low volume on Sunday), or double for longer term trend capture
* 30 days in a month
* 2 trading months in crypto = 60 days

**Ichimoku cloud settings for cryptocurrency trading:**

| Parameter | Value |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Conversion line period | 20 |
| Base line period | 30 |
| Lagging span 2 periods | 120 |
| Displacement | 60 |

Basic reading of the Ichimoku cloud:

**BASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bullish signals**

For a strong bullish signal, everything must occur above the Kumo cloud: The price action must remain **above** the Kumo cloud. The Chinkou line must stay **above** the kumo and Tenken should be crossing Kinjun also **above** the Kumo. Tenken should be crossing upside - if this cross occurs inside of the Kumo that's still bullish but not so strongly bullish.

**BASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bearish signals**

If you are looking for strong bearish signal, with Ichimoku cloud you can pretty much reverse all that has been said to bullish signals - price action occurs **below** Kumo, as well as Tenken and Kinjun crossing and the lagging line Chinkou. Basically the more happens below the stronger the bears are.

**BASICS: None of this?**

If none of this is happening then it most likely means that at your timeframe the market is *undecided, sideways, waiting for direction*. Don't worry, if a breakout happens the traders of twitter and reddit will call it - keep reading to learn whom to follow.
