There is a reason for the selloff, if you are looking for one.

Some multisig wallets with contracts for ICOs created with certain versions of Parity are vulnerable and getting drained. 

So far all ICO money for Edgeless Casino, aeternity and swarm.city is gone. It is 153k ETH which was worth about $32M when the heist started. At the moment it is around $30M. [This is where the coins were sent to](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32#internaltx).

The bug has not been fixed yet so the draining might be going to continue for a while longer, unless money is moved out of vulnerable wallets in time.
