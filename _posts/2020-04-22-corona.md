Hello world.

Now that everyone on the planet lives in the same way crypto traders have for a variable number of past years, it might be time to dispel the rumors that absolutely nothing has changed.

This article is just to point you to all the new stuff on the website that could be useful, but you have missed it if you only get the post feed.

### Trading Strategy Long-Reads

{% amp700cloud {{page.image[1]}} %}

In the trading strategy section, we publish longform posts on strategies for trading on all timeframes.

The posts published there go quite in depth into stuff like [market timing](/strategy/timing/) or [scalping](/strategy/scalping/) but also into different kinds of speculation: The very [long-term bull position of DCA](/strategy/dca/) or the considerations to take in the [lending market](/strategy/cryptocurrency-lending/).

We have published those as they seemed relevant at the time. That means to a newcomer, the whole strategy section might seem chaotic. To make it easier for anyone who wants to enter the crypto markets hopefully with not too emotional decisions, we have now labeled the posts based on how advanced you should be before you tackle each problem.

### Crypto OPSEC and Security Primers

{% amp700cloud {{page.image[2]}} %}

In the section with longreads for opsec, or security, we have done something similar: All opsec articles are now grouped by tag.

The [opsec page](https://www.altcointrading.net/security/) starts with easy overview of the recently reported threats to traders and hodlers labaled as `in the news`, continues with `primers` and goes all the way to the full tutorials under `stay away save lives`.

### How To

{% amp700cloud {{page.image[3]}} %}

As for the easier stuff, you'll find it all under [Guides](https://www.altcointrading.net/guides/) in the top menu. Think of it as the basics of the basics: A good example is this [guide on how to correctly set up your Bitfinex mobile app](/bitfinex-app/) so that you don't defeat the purpose of it's (pretty good) security features just because you're being careless.

There's going to be more stuff on how to start trading in this section later on.

### TradingView Script Spotlight

{% amp700cloud {{page.image[4]}} %}

Script Spotlights are the blog posts where we review TradingView scripts that are available in the TradingView FREE plan from the public library.

This is one of the most useful parts of this website, and so it deserves its own section. Since recently we're collecting all the Script Spotlight reviews on the following tag page.

### Crypto Trading Glossary

{% amp700cloud {{page.image[5]}} %}

And finally the latest addition to the website is the glossary. There are some technical analysis terms that new traders sometimes don't know, such as [squishy](/glossary/squishy/) but also some pretty regular TA terms like [divergences](/glossary/divergence/) that will put together the utter basics you practically need to know about that term and link to the blogs and trading strategies that feature it for more detail.

### Instagram

{% amp700cloud {{page.image[6]}} %}

Last but not least, Instagram.

We've set this up purely to hang some shill links on a social network but it could be we'll post updates on there too.

Either way, it seems like everyone is tired of people posting *genuinely interesting* content and there's demand for people to simply, you know, follow back and mute.

So in case you're in that market, we're not too good for a followback either.
