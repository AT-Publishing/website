> It is incredible how fast the markets have changed. This article was written in January 2017 when people commonly traded at Poloniex and normally referred to altcoin/BTC pairs as their altcoin trading. Since that, we got past the age of Tether trading and finally altcoin/USD pairs on Bitfinex started getting some considerable volume and other exchanges started adding established coins like LTC, XMR and ETH. Since that, people trade altcoin/fiat pairs more commonly and refer to altcoin/BTC as "the ratio".   

### Getting altcoins for fiat

##### **BitStamp** / EU, US and most of the world (SEPA, wire)

* Resides in: EU
* Altcoins: **Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin**

{% aff Bitstamp's tradeview https://www.bitstamp.net/market/tradeview/ %} is good and very reliable exchange. If you live in the EU, you can send them a SEPA that will be cleared the following day -- although sometimes they do have delays, especially when new customers flow in. Bitstamp takes US customers too, [they can even purchase coins with a credit card](https://www.bitstamp.net/article/card-purchases-bitcoin-now-available-usa/). Bitstamp banks in Slovenia so be prepared that your bank might call you and ask whether it was really you sending money somewhere to Slovenia.

You need to be fully verified to have any access to trading and you will find that Bitstamp has deposit and withdrawal limits that trigger additional KYC in form of a questionnaire. Their support is responsive which is [rare among cryptocurrency businesses](https://www.altcointrading.net/customer-support-zen) to say the least.

You shouldn't have issues getting verified from most countries of the world, instant buys are also available [quite widely](https://www.bitstamp.net/article/debit-cc-payments-bitcoin-now-extended-beyond-eu/).

The only drawback is their slow trading engine and fee rounding: Bitstamp rounds up the fee for every partial purchase which makes the whole trade relatively expensive. The engine also matches only slowly so for daytrading it can be a nerve-wrecking experience where you eventually resort to market orders placed ahead of the market.

There is no margin trading but it's in the works.

**Bottom Line:** Bitstamp is a good exchange to buy from but not to trade at.

##### **Bitfinex** / All world [except verified US customers](https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/227) (wire only for mid-5 figures and up)

* Resides in: British Virgin Islands
* Altcoins: IOTA, EOS, Santiment, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ether Classic, Zcash, Monero, DASH, Chain split tokens ...

{% aff Get 10% off fees on Bitfinex https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC %}

It is [not easy to get fiat to and from Bitfinex]() but their trading interface has no competition. If you want to margin  trade one of the coins that are listed on Bitfinex, go for it.

People don't trust Bitfinex because their [parent company is involved with Tether which is the subject of popular conspiracy theories](https://www.altcointrading.net/altcoin-exchanges/).

* [Customer support is unresponsive](https://www.altcointrading.net/customer-support-zen).
* Margin trading and margin funding is enabled and working mostly OK but you will get the occasional fuckup.
* Cryptocurrency deposits get cranky often, especially with ETH and IOTA. Watch out for [PSAs like sending ETH from Bitstamp](https://www.altcointrading.net/bitifinex-eats-your-eth).

**Bottom Line:** To buy from Bitfinex for fiat, contact their customer support and ask them whether they would be willing to do a fiat deposit with *your amount* of *fiat currency*. If they say yes, you will get your altcoin from the most liquid market or maybe OTC, which they also do, and you will pay lower fee than on other exchanges. [Bitfinex was hacked in Aug 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack) but if you are willing to keep money on [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC) only for the duration of your trade you are reasonably safe using them.


##### **Kraken** / EU, US and most of the world (SEPA, wire)

* Resides in: US
* Altcoins: Ethereum, Monero, Ether Classic, Litecoin, Augur, Dogecoin, Iconomi, Lumen, Ripple, Zcash...

Kraken is one of the least reliable exchanges in terms of platform availability -- it crashes **every time** there is a substantial price action.

{% aff Kraken fee structure coin by coin https://www.kraken.com/en-gb/help/fees %} shows the fees are quite low, certainly lower than Bitstamp, but don't think you will get anywhere using market orders.

They recently [acquired the charting portal Cryptowat.ch](https://www.altcointrading.net/kraken-cryptowatch/) and trading from *trade.kraken.com* is a little better but the functionality is still very sub-par.

**Bottom Line:** Don't use Kraken.


### Buying bitcoin first

Getting an altcoin for your bitcoins that you already bought on {% aff localbitcoins https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=4nq3 %} or elsewhere is the classic way to start holding or trading altcoins.

##### **Buy and hold small amount of altcoin**

If you just want to quickly buy an altcoin like Monero, Ether, Dash, Factom or other, you can use ShapeShift. The fees are a little bit higher -- basically Shapeshift trades on Poloniex and Bittrex for you so that you don't have to -- but if you are looking to buy a couple hundred dollars worth only, it might be a viable option as the fees won't add up to much.

You don't need a user account, you simply send in the money. You need to have bitcoins or an altcoin and a wallet to which you want to send the altcoin. Some desktop wallets already have Shapeshift on board - such as [Jaxx](https://jaxx.io) and [Exodus](https://exodus.io).

{% aff ShapeShift https://shapeshift.io/#/coins %}

##### **Buy and hold larger amount of altcoin**

In general, you will be better off using either Bitstamp, Bitfinex or Bittrex for larger BTC-to-altcoin trades. Choose according to your preference:

* [Bitstamp](https://bitstamp.net) is the only one that will need to have you verified.
* [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com) has a withdrawal limit of 100 BTC worth a day for unverified accounts.
* [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC) has the lowest fees.  

##### **Trading Alt/BTC pairs**

###### *Polo*

The former mecca of altcoin trading was [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com). They listed a lot of new coins fast, all the intial trading of a new coin used to happen there. They have spot, margin and lending -- but their website is too cranky, full of bugs that rip people off left right and center and support is unresponsive.

###### *Bittrex*

[Bittrex](https://bittrex.com) is the altcoin gambling place of the season nowadays. The have so many markets and the occasional fault in automated market makers makes for nice arb opportunities if you are in the right place at the right time. Support is quite unresponsive.

###### *Smaller exchanges*

* **ICO tokens** these days get listed first on [Liqui](https://liqui.io/) or [EtherDelta](https://etherdelta.com/).
* Tokens that nobody ever heard of, like SAN, get listed on [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC).
* Try and **avoid** Hitbtc, they don't have a good reputation.

### Altcoin Storage: The Altcoin Wallets

You have two options - an altcoin-specific wallet or a multi-altcoin wallet. In any case, it is always a bad idea to leave your coin on an exchange. That doesn't mean that an altcoin in an altcoin-specific wallet is automatically 100% safe though.

Keep in mind that all altcoins are works in progress - even the big ones like Ether. **There are bugs in the software**. [See the Ethereum's Mist release notes on Github](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases)

Because of that, proprietary wallets might not always be the best bet. The Jaxx might be much better - but it doesn't support all the altcoins.

You will need to compromise a bit but it certainly won't hurt if you simulate cold storage by having your desktop wallets on a computer that is mostly offline and that you don't use for your day to day web browsing or downloading.
