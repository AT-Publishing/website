### Hiding your wallet files

### What to do with your private keys

It's become an old saying that your seed to a wallet shouldn't get onto your computer. (Almost as old as *don't leave too much money on an exchange*.) What to do with them though? When you don't


### Hacking for the paranoid

Like [Mr Novogratz said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-09-26/how-macro-trader-novogratz-became-a-bitcoin-convert-video), if you have a crypto wallet access data hidden under your kitchen sink and the wallet has hundred million dollars on it, you want a guy sitting there watching your kitchen sink, right?

Here comes the juicy part. There is a lovely and very old technique called [steganography](http://acrigs.com/FRAVIA/stego.htm). Steganography in the broad sense is science of hiding information.

In the digital age, it means appending hidden data to a file that can be used after that without anyone suspecting anything.

One good way to do it could be appending your sensitive data to some inconspicuous kind of file that everyone has on their computer - maybe to a family photo on your normal laptop or to a screenshot of man page or some tutorial on a Raspberry Pi. **On Linux and Mac you don't need any extra packages to pull it off** which makes it even more attractive.

If you are cheeky enough you could try to upload your picture online somewhere (nobody knows whats in it anyway, right?). Well, don't do it - most upload systems process the image to save space and check for any bizarre data that could be a security threat. This will strip your extra data you appended to your image.

A more reasonable system is to have maybe a directory with your most favorite family photos (or photos of your favorite artworks or memes or whatever - it is so common to do this), each of them having some encrypted data appended. The directory would then be made a regular archive.

A photo archive like that can be backed up on an external hard drive or on your cold/warm device like Raspberry Pi that doesn't go online.

If you think you could sleep well like that, data packed the way described above should survive a cloud backup too. It is both encrypted and in a place where nobody would look for them.
