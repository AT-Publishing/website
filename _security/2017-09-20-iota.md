#### What is IOTA

IOTA is a transactional and data transfer layer aiming at the Internet of Things. It uses a distributed ledger called [Tangle](https://www.altcointrading.net/iota) which scales better than Blockchain - the more it is used the more efficient it gets.

The tangle ledger is based on something called DAG (directed acyclic graph). Each transaction forms its own "block" and is essentially verified by itself. In order to put your transaction through you have to verify two other randomly chosen older transactions in the network. This is done with help of a very simple version of proof-of-work but the needed PoW is so cheap that the transaction cost is still essentially zero.

Thanks to this, through IOTA people can transfer money without any fees. This means that even tiny nanopayments can be made with IOTA - ideal for automated transactions in the IoT.

Currently you are only able to trade IOTA on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bitfinex.com/?refcode=5egV78YtlC" target="_blank">Bitfinex</a> and the Australian CoinSpot. The deposits and withdrawals on Bitfinex are a bit janky and there have been some concerns if [Bitfinex is trusted at all considering the Tether controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOTAmarkets/comments/71dau9/bitfinex_tether_situation/) - read more about [Bitfinex here](https://www.altcointrading.net/altcoin-exchanges/#bitfinex). Recently [new exchanges with IOTA integration were promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOTAmarkets/comments/719sug/new_exchange_is_our_one_true_saviour/) though.


### Download IOTA wallet

There is no selection of full vs light clients like you might know from BTC and blockchain based altcoins. The official IOTA wallet interface is simply a GUI for your seed. Currently the seed is not generated for you - you need to do it yourself. IOTA seed is a string of 81 characters consisting **only of uppercase latin letters and 9's**.

**Download your IOTA wallet from the release section of the *iotaledger* github only:**

[github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases)

The IOTA wallet is available for Windows, Mac and Linux (both as deb and rpm).

### Generate IOTA seed

The seed string can be absolutely anything, as long as it's 81 characters of uppercase latin letters and 9s. There are websites that generate the seed for you but in this way you are depending on their good will of not snooping on you, so this way of seed generation shouldn't be encouraged.

Also, [don't be tempted to use a line from your favorite song](https://privsec.blog/song-lyric-passwords/):

> I wanted to create a short program to show that this type of password is also insecure. Using Python with a few simple libraries, I created this script that generates a password list based on a given artist. Discovering someone’s favorite band is pretty easy… that sort of thing is plastered all over social media, and it’s usually something people will provide when asked by anyone. (via [privsec.blog, includes the python code](https://privsec.blog/song-lyric-passwords/))

On Linux and Mac, hands down the best option is to open up the terminal and generate a random string like this:

`cat /dev/urandom |LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Z9' | fold -w 81 | head -n 1`

**If you want to store your seed on paper, simply write it down now and you are done here.**

**If you want to store your IOTA seed on a computer you need to encrypt it.** The best way is to encrypt the seed right after its generation, without having had the plaintext seed on your laptop at all:

```
cat /dev/urandom |LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Z9' | fold -w 81 \
 | head -n 1 | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -out paranoia.enc
```

The command above will ask you for password - choose something strong. You can verify the file is encrypted by trying `cat paranoia.enc`. If you want a different cipher check what's available with `openssl list-cipher-algorithms`.

Decrypting the file on Mac goes like this:

`openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in paranoia.enc`

This is the first time you are ever seeing your IOTA seed. You can copy it from the command line and login into your wallet.

The command will show your seed on the screen only without creating a file on the disk for it. It is far from bulletproof but it is better than [generating a plaintext file with the seed on your hard drive and then trying to securely remove it](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7675060?start=0&tstart=0).

*The above is also a better way rather than writing the string into a file and then encrypt it which brings up the problem with secure removal of files:*

```
cat /dev/urandom |LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Z9' | fold -w 81 | head -n 1 >> testfilename
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in testfilename -out file.enc
```


### IOTA cold storage

The previous paragraph can be upgraded into a cold storage solution if it's done on an air-gapped laptop or a Raspberry Pi: a clean, secure device that is not connected to the internet and when it has ever been, it was to download packages from official repos and sync blockchains - not to watch hentai from dodgy servers with malware in ads.

You do need an internet to install the IOTA wallet (the GUI) and to login and see your receiving address but the seed generation via command line doesn't need internet at all. If you have a separate device for coins and go offline for the generation, then open your wallet and copy your address in the Receive tab and **move that address only** to your computer for normal daily use, and only connect to the internet on your storage computer to check balances when withdrawing, that's reasonably safe.

#### Receiving and sending IOTA

If you want to receive IOTA for the first time you may click "Attach to tangle" in the IOTA wallet but it is not needed, you will receive your money without it just the same.

Sending is done from the GUI just by specifying the address and amount (be careful about the units).
