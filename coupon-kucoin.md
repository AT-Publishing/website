#### About Kucoin

Kucoin is a new altcoin exchange that trades cryptocurrency pairs - BTC, ETH, NEO, USDT and KCS (Kucoin Shares). The CEO of Kucoin has background in Alibaba.

KCS is the exchange's own token Kucoin Shares. Users who hold it receive an additional bonus which can effectively lower their fees.

Kucoin lists new cryptocurrencies regularly as they become popular (a new recent addition is RaiBlocks). They also typically grant forked tokens for bitcoin holders and participate in airdrops.

**There is an 20% fee discount for users who sign up with a referral code.**
