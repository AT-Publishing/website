**Christmas Deals 2018**

They do say bear markets are the time for development, experimenting and positioning on the market. And so this year for Christmas, apparently thanks to the crypto price slump, everyone is at it with promos and special offers.

Most offers are valid through the whole month of December 2018 so in case you're a daytrader who hasn't been faring the best in the 2018 bear market, you can still wait for your festive McDonalds paycheck. (I hope that's still a joke.)

## Confirmed Crypto Deals for Christmas 2018

### Ledger Nano S Christmas 2018 Deal

{{ site.ledger_dec_728-90 }}

Ledger is having a -30% promotion on the Nano S starting right up until the end of the year 2018. There are no conditions for this offer and it is applies on all Nano S wallets.

```
30% off on each Ledger Nano S
```

Remember that with Nano S, catching them in stock is often an issue. The actual Black Friday 2018 deal **won't get better than 30% off**, if you are still waiting you might as well get your Ledgers now.

Ledger wallet is currently the most trusted hardware wallet for bitcoin and altcoins. The wallet code is fully open source and the devs are available on Reddit whenever you have a serious problem with something.

The Ledger Nano S supports a mass of altcoins, including all ERC20 compliant tokens. Other than Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Zcash, Ethereum and forks, Ledger also supports cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Stratis via Ledger's Companion Apps. Ledger Nano S also supports Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold.

Even though the device does support a lot of cryptocurrencies, it doesn't have enough memory to hold wallet apps for all of them. That is generally the reason why people buy multiple Ledgers.

Ledger also released several colored versions of their wallets which is helpful in telling apart hardware wallets holding different coin.

Ledger Nano S normally retails at a regular price of **up to 69.90 EUR** (price varies based on your location - the US retail price is still 58 EUR excl. tax). On Black Fridays customers get between **21% and 50% discount** on all Nano S orders, the current promo is therefore somewhere in the middle of the discount range you're able to get.

## Keepkey Christmas 2018 deal

The Trezor spinoff Keepkey stopped sleeping on end-of-year deals and is offering a good deal for a duo pack of KeepKey bitcoin vaults.

There is no discount code or limitation to this offer. If you put two Keepkey wallets into your cart, the price will update at checkout.

**In total you are saving 129 USD with this deal.**
