**Ethereum as a platform**

Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

ETC or ETH "Classic" is worth steadily about 10% of ETH and it is the underlying asset of the proposed [Ethereum ETF](https://grayscale.co/ethereum-investment-trust/).
