## August 2020 Deal: Ledger Wallets Bundles - 16-21% Discount

{{ site.stars.five }}

Ledger wallet keeps with their usual strategy of discounting wallet bundles through the year, and in 2020 we get 3 different Ledger wallet bundles.

You can get multiple Nano S devices, multiple Nano X wallets or the baxkup pack which has one of each.

The discount is higher if your pack has more of Nano S wallets, as the Ledger Nano S is the older product.

##### 2020 Ledger Backup Pack Discounts:

* **Ledger Nano S family Pack**: 3x Ledger Nano S ~ **21% off**
  * [GO TO OFFER](http://bit.ly/ebf-nanos3x)
* **Ledger Backup Pack**: 1x Ledger Nano S + 1x Ledger Nano X ~ **18% off**
  * [GO TO OFFER](http://bit.ly/ebf-bakp)
* **Ledger Nano X family Pack**: 3x Ledger Nano X ~ **16% off**
  * [GO TO OFFER](http://bit.ly/ebf-nanox3x)


##### Why it's good to have more than one hardware wallet

The best way to make use of the Ledger discount code deal is to have as big a total bill as possible:

* You can buy Ledger Nano X to use as your cold-ish storage. The Ledger Nano X is a Bluetooth® enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.
* Ledger Nano S is cheaper but can pretty much operate with a single crypto on it only, due to the small memory. That makes it ideal for a single-purpose wallet.
* So, if you trade mostly with, say, Bitcoin as your base currency, Ledger Nano S is the most time-, cost- and security-efficient wallet to serve as your trading wallet.

It's also useful to have a separate wallet for the darknetmarkets. Speaking purely hypothetically of course.

## Past Black Friday Offers - What we got in 2019

<div id="tradingview-black-friday-price"></div>



<div id="airvpn-discount"></div>
  
## AirVPN Discount on Black Friday: 74% OFF

{{ site.stars.five }}

AirVPN is the well known VPN provider that accepts Bitcoin payments (directly, without any intermediaries) and is very much focused on user privacy in all aspects. But if you don't want to waste your crypto on AirVPN, they also accept PayPal and bank cards.

The AirVPN.org website doesn't even track cookies or marketing data.

For the Black Friday 2019, they offered up to 74% discount on AirVPN plans. The discount grew with the length of the plan.

* AirVPN **3 year subscription** plan with the Black Friday deal: `99 EUR -> 64.35 EUR` (**1 year free** compared to yearly pricing, or monthly Airvpn cost of **1.79 EUR**)
* AirVPN **2 year subscription** plan with the Black Friday deal: `79 EUR -> 51.35 EUR`
* AirVPN **2 year subscription** plan with the Black Friday deal: `49 EUR -> 31.85 EUR`

With the Black Friday deal, AirVPN can get you a decent VPN service for a monthly price that is less than what in many countries costs a cup of supermarket coffee.

* For long subscriptions, it definitely pays off to wait for the next AirVPN Black Friday offer.
* If you need VPN now, get one of the [shorter plans](http://bit.ly/airvpn-2020) now and rebuy a long one on Black Friday.

<p><a class="btn" href="http://bit.ly/airvpn-2020">Get Airvpn before Black Friday 2020</a></p>

## Anticipated Crypto Deals for BlackFriday 2020

In the rest of this bloody long post on AltcoinTrading.NET you can also learn of what kind of offers we got last year during **Black Friday 2018/2019** and the previous years. Successful campaigns are most likely to repeat (or rhyme) in November 2020.


#### Ledger Nano X Black Friday 2020: Anticipated Site-Wide Discount

Every year, Ledger wallet Black Friday deals come in a sequence.

Whereas during the year, crypto hodlers can get a good deal with bundles, on Black Friday Ledger typically does site-wide discounts.

* **[Get the current Backup Bundle offer](http://bit.ly/bpbf-2019)**

In 2019 the first wave of pre-BlackFriday sale came with 30% off site-wide at Ledger. It was not as low as it could get, but there was enough stock and the discount applied even on Ledger Nano X which was still a new product.

##### Ledger Nano X Black Friday 2020: Anticipated 30% Off

{{ site.stars.five }}

The Ledger Nano X is a Bluetooth® enabled secure device that stores the private keys of your cryptocurrencies. It has extended memory capacity, which means it can house keys of more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.

Nano X is still the top product that Ledger has, so we do not expect much hotter deals than 30% off.

**[More about Ledger Nano X](http://bit.ly/ledger-nano-x)**


#### Ledger Nano S Black Friday 2020: Anticipated 70% Off

{{ site.stars.five }}

Ledger Wallet did the Black Friday 2017 offer of 21% off on your Ledger Ledger Nano S, but in Black Friday 2018, the disount on Nano S went up to 50% discount.

In 2019, Nano S buyers could get it with as much as 60% off, albeit for a short time in a bundle deal.

The pattern is clear however that as the product gets older, the discount in sales events grows. We are anticipating the 2020 Black Friday deal on Ledger Nano S to be around 70% off.
